Your powers fall into two broad categories: melee attacks your spirit companion makes, and ranged attacks. Your daily powers include a number of conjurations and zones, representing your ability to call on additional spirits for aid.\\n\\nReligion\\nShamans draw their power from the primal power source and therefore don't usually worship gods. They view themselves as agents—not servants or masters—of the spirits of nature and instruct others how to live their lives in harmony with those spirits. Like druids, shamans call on the spirits to witness significant events but don't worship them.\"},{\"@name\":\"Implement\",\"$\":\"Shamans use totems carved to resemble the spirits they most commonly call upon, particularly their spirit companions. When you wield a magic totem, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of shaman powers and shaman paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers.\"},{\"@name\":\"Powers\",\"$\":\"Your powers evoke primal spirits that you view as partners and revered elders. Many of your powers channel primal energy through your spirit companion and have the spirit keyword, including powers that have “spirit” as part of the range. Those powers treat your spirit companion's space as the origin square for the power, so “melee spirit 1” means you can target a creature adjacent to your spirit.\\nOther shaman powers call on other spirits to intervene in the course of battle on your behalf, and many of those spirits then channel their energy through your spirit companion either to benefit allies or to harm enemies.\"},{\"@name\":\"Power Name\",\"$\":\"Evocations\"},{\"@name\":\"_RoleElement\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_ROLE_2\"},{\"@name\":\"_PowerSourceElement\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_SOURCE_4\"},{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"You command the services of a faithful spirit guide, using it to inspire allies and destroy enemies.\"}],\"rules\":{\"grant\":{\"@name\":\"ID_INTERNAL_GRANTS_SHAMAN\",\"@type\":\"Grants\"},\"select\":[{\"@type\":\"Power\",\"@number\":\"1\",\"@Category\":\"$$CLASS,at-will,1\"},{\"@type\":\"Build\",\"@number\":\"1\",\"@Category\":\"$$CLASS\",\"@optional\":\"true\"},{\"@type\":\"Skill Training\",\"@number\":\"3\",\"@Category\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_147\"}],\"textstring\":{\"@name\":\"_CLASSNAME\",\"@value\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_147\"},\"statadd\":[{\"@name\":\"_LEVEL-ONE-HPS\",\"@value\":\"+12\"},{\"@name\":\"_PER-LEVEL-HPS\",\"@value\":\"+5\"},{\"@name\":\"Healing Surges\",\"@value\":\"+7\"},{\"@name\":\"Fortitude Defense Class Bonus\",\"@value\":\"+1\"},{\"@name\":\"Will Defense Class Bonus\",\"@value\":\"+1\"}]},\"$\":\"Shamans are inspiring and dangerous battle leaders.
