Such a paladin shoulders injuries to keep comrades unharmed and compels enemies to strike him or her first, rather than the paladin's allies. By invoking divine magic, such cavaliers can sacrifice their vitality and strength to protect those who are weaker, and they gladly do so.\nA cavalier of sacrifice must be ready to give up anything—money, status, power, or life itself-to defend those too weak to shield themselves from evil. Cavaliers of sacrifice are renowned because of the hardships they endure for the good of others. You sleep in a stable while your allies rest in an inn, to save a few coins for the poor. You wear little more than simple, peasant's garb when not in armor and are an ascetic devoted to your cause, willing to endure any ill or pain to prevent others from suffering it.\nEven though the virtue of sacrifice carries a heavy cost, you must temper your actions with humility. You give up so much, but that sacrifice does not make you more noble than others. Pride is your enemy, because it threatens to lead you to arrogance and ultimately disdain for those you protect. Cavaliers of sacrifice who fall to evil become even more villainous due to the great distance they tumble.\n   *Alignment: A cavalier of sacrifice must be lawful good. The virtue of sacrifice demands much from its adherents. Only the most honorable cavaliers embrace it.\n   *You gain an additional healing surge. In addition, you can use your second wind as a minor action to heal an ally of your choice within 5 squares of you. If you do so, you gain no benefit from using your second wind, but the ally regains hit points equal to his or her healing surge value.\nVirtue of Valor:\nA cavalier of valor focuses on martial prowess and aggressive attacks against enemies. He or she brings the fight to foes, protecting allies by forcing enemies to respond to divine attacks. The virtue of valor emphasizes unflinching bravery in the face of a powerful enemy, and bards' stories are filled with tales of cavaliers of valor who lived up to the name, riding out to challenge dragons, demon lords, and other mighty champions of evil.\nOn the battlefield, you are the pinnacle of bravery. You stand resolute against any foe, from a seemingly endless wave of kobolds to a mountain-shaking titan. Without valor, the other virtues lose meaning and impact. To stand against a daunting foe or to hold tight to the exacting standards of the order of cavaliers both of these tasks require faultless valor. You stand at the forefront of a battle, taking the vanguard position to both strike at your foes and shield your allies from your enemies' most ferocious attacks. In this manner, your adherence to valor ensures that your bravery serves as a stirring example.\nValor must be tempered with wisdom. The valorous cavalier does not fight for the sake of fighting, but for the just cause. Valor turns to bloodlust when a cavalier fails to see that skill at arms is only one solution. Tales abound of valorous cavaliers who have fallen to evil. They didn't abandon their virtue, but rather lost the wisdom needed to wield it for good.\n   *Alignment: A cavalier of valor can be lawful good, good, or unaligned.

Others seek glory, power, or prestige. There are a few, however, who seek the warrior's path for reasons that transcend the material and mundane. Called by divine powers to stand as champions of the light against the ever-encroaching darkness, paladins fight not because they choose to, but because, deep within their souls, they know they must. The paladin's life is not a choice. It is a destiny.\n     Paladins are holy warriors, defenders of good and enemies of evil. Paladins are well trained with their weapons and armor, but they augment that skill with divine powers that allow them to shield their allies and smite their enemies. A single paladin can turn the tide of an entire war through a combination of skill at arms and inspiring leadership. As icons of virtue and heroism, paladins are a deadly threat to those who would rule through fear, intimidation, and violence.\n     Paladins typically wander the land either alone or in small groups. They seek out wrongs to right and villainy to defeat. Most paladins begin as squires to more experienced holy warriors. Through training and arduous tests, a squire's bravery, battle skill, and ethics are all tested to see if the squire is worthy of becoming a paladin.\n     A cavalier is a paladin who has embraced one of the heroic virtues, such as compassion, justice, sacrifice, or valor. His or her belief in this virtue is so strong that it manifests as divine magic. Although many cavaliers pledge their faith to the gods, others follow no specific religion. Regardless of one's divine affiliation (or lack thereof), a cavalier's virtue stands paramount. It guides his or her actions, pointing to the best way to protect the ever-flickering light of hope and civilization in the world.\n\t Opposing the cavaliers and the virtues that they champion are the blackguards, who embody the dreaded vices that the cavaliers stand against. Where cavaliers embrace compassion, justice, sacrifice, and valor, blackguards epitomize fury, tyranny, greed, and terror. Since the earliest days of history, these two factions have fought each other. Both wander the land, gathering allies and working to further the cause of their virtues or vices.\n     At one time, cavaliers formed into chivalrous orders that were dedicated to the ideal of protecting the civilized realms. The forgotten kingdoms that ruled the land relied on cavaliers to help keep the peace. Those cavaliers maintained not only the military security of the land, but also its moral strength. A cavalier might drive off a marauding troll, but she could also mediate a dispute between two farmers, break the power of a corrupt noble, or free a wrongly accused prisoner.\n     As with many things from the time of the forgotten kingdoms, the cavaliers' glory proved fleeting. The kingdoms of old grew weak, and some of their decline could be laid at the feet of cavaliers who strayed from the righteous path. All too often, cavaliers fell victim to the very evils they had sworn to combat. Power corrupts, and in many cases cavaliers served as perfect examples of how power can twist the most resolute heart.\n     The grand orders of cavaliers have long since faded, but their glory is not forgotten. Even as evil casts its shadow across the land, there are those who hear the call to the cavalier's path. Many of the cavaliers of old strayed from their purpose, but that purpose and the power behind it remains strong for those who stay true to it."},{"@name":"Cavalier","@type":"Grants","@internal-id":"ID_INTERNAL_GRANTS_CAVALIER","@source":"Player Essentials: Heroes of the Forgotten
