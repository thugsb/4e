Singers, acrobats, poets, dancers, and storytellers, minstrels tour the cities of Athas in troupes or individually, making a living with their wits and talents. The civilized peoples of Athas have long celebrated minstrels, and by tradition all but the poorest or most suspicious of hosts are proud to open their doors to traveling performers. Hosting a minstrel or sponsoring a troupe's performance reflects well on the host, and most Athasians are eager to forget their troubles with a few hours of song and dance. Nobles often send troupes of minstrels to one another as gifts; it is seen as a great insult to refuse such a gift, even when all involved know that minstrels are often spies or assassins.\\n\\tThe most skilled (or fortunate) minstrels are highly paid companions to nobility, trusted advisors or agents who enjoy the most intimate confidences of their patrons. Minstrels are often retained by noble houses to tutor young nobles or teach them about the world. They might serve as bodyguards and fighting instructors at the same time. Minstrels who belong to a troupe lack the comfort and trust bestowed on a kept minstrel, but they enjoy the freedom to travel and the aid of a network of informants and allies throughout the Tyr Region. The poorest and most humble minstrels are simple wandering storytellers or jugglers who perform for their supper from night to night.\\n\\tMany minstrels have a dark side they conceal beneath their charm and talent. Those with ambition and ruthlessness find opportunities in the employ of the elite classes. Minstrels often lead double lives as blackmailers, thieves, spies, or assassins; a minstrel's visit or a troupe's performance might conceal a mission of espionage or murder. They are renowned as masters of poison, concealed weapons, and subtle trickery. Even the humblest wandering minstrel with threadbare cloak and battered lyre might be more than he or she seems-there's no better spy than someone who seems harmless and is welcome wherever he or she goes.\\nCreating: All minstrels are skilled performers or artists. Naturally, many are bards. However, you might be an assassin or a rogue who conceals your true talents with dancing or juggling, a battlemind specializing in tricks of the mind, or even a fighter or a warlord whose musical ability is secondary to your talent for teaching young nobles how to look after themselves.\"},{\"@name\":\"Poisoned Strike\",\"@type\":\"Power\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_11749\",\"@source\":\"Dark Sun Campaign Setting\",\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"You splash a few drops of poison on your weapon from a vial at your belt, and slash at your foe.

From crowded marketplaces crawling with thieves, to caravans wending across difficult wastes, to the isolated settlements and trading posts found in the places between the great city-states, dune traders are everywhere, pushing their wares on anyone they encounter. Dune traders bring needed goods to remote areas, offering water, food, arms, and more, but their work is not charity. Such offerings come at the highest prices a merchant can ask and still be able to move the merchandise. It's all about making a profit, and no one does a better job at looking out for themselves and their wealth than the dune traders of Athas.\\n\\tMany small traders and merchant cabals exist, but they pale next to the dynastic houses that dominate trade across the Tyr Region. These houses are nations unto themselves, sworn to no sorcerer-king but allied with all. They field their own armies, hold their own lands, and take an active part in political and social developments affecting the region. A merchant house's leadership might rest in one family's hands, but these houses readily accept new members, always looking for new talent to bolster their presence and influence in the Tyr Region. Regardless of the position sought, candidates must swear several oaths to the house leaders. In exchange, a candidate receives protection, status, and regular pay. The particular oaths vary from house to house, but the following are common to them all.\\n• Forsake any citizenship or membership in a city-state or tribe.\\n• Swear allegiance to the merchant house.\\n• Always act in the merchant house's best interest.\\n• Deal honestly with stranger, friend, and foe.\\n• Flaunt no wealth gained through employment by the house.\\n• Uphold the local laws and always act in accordance with them.\\n• Protect your own, lending help to merchants in need and refusing to deal with those who unjustly imprison or harass any merchant.\\n\\tIn contrast to the great dynastic houses of the city-states, elven merchant tribes are small and mobile. They do not enjoy the peaceful relations enjoyed by the dynastic houses and, for this reason, they are not beholden to any oaths or promises. They foist off junk, deal in contraband, and sometimes resort to base robbery if given sufficient cause. Elven houses tend to be tribal in structure, but they are as widespread and as dangerous as any human organization.\\nCreating: The merchant houses populating the Tyr Region welcome anyone with talent into their fold. Rogues and bards have the most to offer merchant houses, since they have the abilities most useful for negotiating and bargaining in the marketplaces. Warlords are excellent caravan leaders, and psionically gifted characters use their subtle arts to ferret out secrets and gain the upper hand over rival houses. Finally, merchant houses frequently recruit muscle such as fighters, wardens, and barbarians to ensure that caravans arrive at their destinations.\"},{\"@name\":\"Quick Formation\",\"@type\":\"Power\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_11778\",\"@source\":\"Dark Sun Campaign Setting\",\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"You lash at your enemies and move your allies into a defensible position.\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Power Usage\",\"$\":\"Encounter\"},{\"@name\":\"Display\",\"$\":\"Dune Trader Attack\"},{\"@name\":\"Keywords\",\"$\":\"Martial, Weapon\"},{\"@name\":\"Action Type\",\"$\":\"Standard Action\"},{\"@name\":\"Attack Type\",\"$\":\"Melee or Ranged weapon\"},{\"@name\":\"Target\",\"$\":\"One creature\"},{\"@name\":\"Attack\",\"$\":\"Primary ability vs. AC\"},{\"@name\":\"Hit\",\"$\":\"1[W] + ability modifier damage, and either you shift 4 squares, or each ally within 5 squares of you can shift 2 squares as a free action.\\nIncrease damage to 2[W] + ability modifier at 11th level.\\nIncrease damage to 3[W] + ability modifier at 21st level.\"},{\"@name\":\"Class\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_THEME_643\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\"},{\"@name\":\"Power Type\",\"$\":\"Attack\"}]},{\"@name\":\"Slick Negotiator\",\"@type\":\"Power\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_11781\",\"@source\":\"Dark Sun Campaign Setting\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"ID_INTERNAL_CATEGORY_UTILITY,ID_INTERNAL_CATEGORY_ENCOUNTER_USAGE,ID_FMP_CLASS_0,ID_FMP_CATEGORY_36,ID_INTERNAL_CATEGORY_FREE_ACTION,2\"},\"Prereqs\":{\"$\":\"ID_FMP_THEME_643\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"You don't let a gaff sabotage your negotiation, and move on as if the misstep never occurred.\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Power Usage\",\"$\":\"Encounter\"},{\"@name\":\"Display\",\"$\":\"Dune Trader Utility 2\"},{\"@name\":\"Keywords\",\"$\":\"Martial\"},{\"@name\":\"Action Type\",\"$\":\"Free Action\"},{\"@name\":\"Attack Type\",\"$\":\"Close burst 5\"},{\"@name\":\"Trigger\",\"$\":\"You or an ally in the burst makes a Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Streetwise check and dislikes the result.\"},{\"@name\":\"Target\",\"$\":\"The triggering creature\"},{\"@name\":\"Effect\",\"$\":\"If you are the target, you gain a +3 power bonus to the skill check result.

Some worship sorcererkings who claim to be divine, or the false deities other sorcerer-kings purport to serve. Some worship demons or primordials-grim, malevolent patrons that frequently demand terrible rites or horrendous acts of sacrifice. But most Athasians instead venerate the living elements as they manifest in the world.\\n\\tElemental priests are those who serve these sullen and fierce spirits. They have a special kinship with the primal elements, a connection so close it's as if they stand in two worlds: that of mortals, and that of raw elemental power. They channel this rage into themselves to call forth the spirits of rock and fire, wind and water, seeking their aid in battle.\\n\\tDozens of elemental cults and priesthoods exist in the Tyr Region. For the most part, these cults are impoverished, weak, and mocked by city dwellers. However, the people who dwell in the villages and wastes have a different opinion of elemental priests. They regard them as holders of powerful and dangerous magic, to be respected or feared accordingly.\\n\\tMany elemental priests revere the nameless, formless principle of all living elements together, making no distinction between one manifestation over another. However, others give themselves to more specific examples of elemental power. For example, the Smoking Crown is home to dwarf priests who serve the spirit of the volcano, whereas the mountain known as An-Bezzumar, the Crown of Heaven, is sacred to goliath wind shamans. The wandering thrikreen mystics known as the Rainspeakers venerate the rare, blessed showers that fall a few times each year during the cooler months and often make pilgrimages to places where rain is soon to fall.\\n\\tHeroic elemental priests are leaders of the village and wasteland folk and potent enemies of the sorcerer-kings and their templars. They are often intermediaries who protect villagers by seeking to placate angry elemental manifestations or summon vanished ones to places where they are needed. Some elemental priests instead follow a monastic or ascetic tradition instead of the more common tribal or village traditions of elemental worship. Your character might therefore be a secret scholar or cultist indoctrinated in a hidden temple, or a semibarbaric elemental priest raised among the people of the wastes.\\nCreating: Elemental priests include wandering healers, mad hermits, secretive cultists, and grim warriors-any character who venerates the elemental spirits of Athas might become an elemental priest. Desert-dwelling dwarves, elves, goliaths, and humans become elemental priests to gain access to a few primal powers, and they identify themselves as servants of the desert spirits. Druids and sorcerers choose this theme to gain powers of healing and protection. Finally, many animist shamans are elemental priests, and they add the potent conjurations of this theme to their own powers.\"},{\"@name\":\"Spirit of Athas\",\"@type\":\"Power\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_11804\",\"@source\":\"Dark Sun Campaign Setting\",\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"A spirit appears, defending you and your allies with its body.\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Power Usage\",\"$\":\"Encounter\"},{\"@name\":\"Display\",\"$\":\"Elemental Priest Attack\"},{\"@name\":\"Keywords\",\"$\":\"Conjuration, Implement, Primal\"},{\"@name\":\"Action Type\",\"$\":\"Minor Action\"},{\"@name\":\"Attack Type\",\"$\":\"Ranged 5\"},{\"@name\":\"Effect\",\"$\":\"You conjure a spirit of Athas.

Water, food, and shelter are never guaranteed, and one misstep can result in a public flogging by an overambitious templar or a swift execution to serve as warning to others who might overstep their bounds. But the sorcerer-kings know that even with loyal templars and vast armies at their command, they rule with their subjects' consent. To distract the masses from their misery, to divert public attention from oppressive laws and heavy taxes, the sorcerer-kings decree the incessant spectacle of gladiatorial games.\\n\\tEach city-state boasts an impressive arena, with enough seating to hold most of its citizens. Each week, or more often depending on weather or political conditions, nobles and commoners gather to watch the drama unfold, cheering madly as their favorite warriors duel with other gladiators, work in teams to claim the contest's great prize, or fight en masse to defeat whatever new horror the arena masters have plucked, no doubt at great expense and loss of life, from the desert wastes.\\n\\tNaturally, most gladiators are slaves. Chosen for this fate because of their strength or skill, they live and die at the crowd's favor, pitting what training they acquire against myriad foes, never knowing when they will face an insurmountable foe, never sure when their opponent will be their equal. Arena masters understand that their warriors fight with passion when they have something to fight for, and so they offer freedom, wealth, pleasure, or some other incentive to stoke the fires and keep their captive warriors eager for victory. Freedom is the greatest prize, of course-but the games are so violent that few gladiators live long enough to earn the victories they need to escape.\\n\\tThe life of a gladiator is brutish and brief, but it is the one occupation a slave can hold that also brings respect. Gladiators are heroes to the common people. Their trials and victories are the stuff of legend, and many slaves grow comfortable from the accolades their conquests bring.\\nCreating: Some gladiators are born to the arena, raised from an early age to fight in front of the crowd. Others find themselves in the pit through no intention of their own-sentenced for a crime or sold into slavery, perhaps-only to discover that they were meant for the blood-soaked sands. A few individuals volunteer to fight in the arena, desperate (or cocky) enough to risk life and limb for a purse of high value.\\n\\tThe gladiator theme is a common choice for fighters, battleminds, and other defenders. The theme powers offer several good options for establishing control over enemies in close combat, a useful talent for any defender.

The members of this social class are largely ineffectual puppets who have no real power, and only rarely do they muster the courage to oppose the plans of the sorcerer-kings. Even when they do so, it's not for the greater good. Most nobles watch out only for their own interests. They care nothing about what happens to people of lower castes, with the possible exception of people they own.\\n\\tThough nobles lack true power, they gain many advantages due to their wealth. Nobles can read and write and can easily acquire food and water, which isn't true for much of the Athasian population. Every noble receives a basic education in psionics, either through a school or from a tutor hired by the noble's family, learning an array of psionic talents to better defend himself or herself against enemies or to command minions. Most lose interest in their training and fall into the same decadent malaise that pervades the noble caste. Only a rare few nobles fully develop their psionic talents, but those who do so are among the most capable and dangerous practitioners of the Way.\\nCreating: Usually, nobles who become adventurers do so after being expelled (or removing themselves) from society. Your character might be a fugitive hiding from assassins working for other noble families or for the templars, a combat leader for your house who seeks new troops or more combat experience, or a rebel who left a noble family because he or she felt sympathy for common people.\\n\\tPower Points: If you choose a noble adept attack power of level 3 or 7 instead of a nonaugmentable encounter attack power at that level, you also gain 2 power points. If you do so with a power of level 13 or 17, you instead gain 4 power points, and if you do so with a power of level 23 or 27, you instead gain 6 power points.

In spite of the supernatural ruin visited over so much of the planet thousands of years ago, the vital force of Athas still flourishes in a few places-the rain-misted jungles of the Forest Ridge, the green palm groves of hidden oases in the Tablelands, the majestic stands of giant cactus that dot the stony barrens in the wilds south of Tyr, creek-fed mountain vales, the dazzling blue waters of the Dragon's Bowl, and a thousand more secret refuges and lost springs.\\n\\tAcross the Tyr Region, sentinels stand watch over these surviving treasures, protecting them from pillaging or defiling at the hands of people too careless, desperate, or wicked to care whether their actions might murder one more piece of a gravely wounded world. These watchers and sentinels are the world's primal guardians, chosen by the spirits or selfappointed to defend the life of Athas.\\n\\tMany primal guardians are hermits who live in or near the lands they guard. Legendary druids such as Enola, the mul guardian of the Dragon's Bowl, and Mearedes, the protector of the island of Shault, are excellent examples. Some of these individuals choose their tasks for themselves, freely taking up the mantle of guardianship over some rare and precious verdant patch hidden in the desert. Others are possessed by the primal spirits, haunted or maddened by visions and bound to the place of the land's need. Still other primal guardians belong to circles or brotherhoods collectively sworn to defend a wide area. Several such circles, consisting mostly of halfling druids and wardens, are scattered throughout the Forest Ridge. Another band known as the Crescent Circle works to defend the Crescent Forest between Gulg and Nibenay. Finally, a few circles are free-roaming orders or societies that keep watch over the whole of the Tyr Region, passing messages to each other and gathering to oppose great dangers when they arise.\\n\\tEven if a primal guardian chooses a single locale to protect, he or she is free to wander the rest of the world. In fact, many guardians begin their careers with an extended time of wandering, learning the secrets of nature's balance throughout Athas and searching for the place of their calling. But even after this time comes to an end, the needs of all of Athas often draw a primal guardian into long journeys away from the place he or she wards.\\n\\tEven more so than elemental priests, primal guardians are people of the deep desert and the remote wilderness. Where the elemental priests seek to instill reverence for the primal elements in the peoples of Athas, primal guardians seek to keep verdant lands hidden and unspoiled. Some conceal trails or wield magic to obscure their warded places, some lure dangerous beasts to lair in the right spot, some spread rumors of death and desolation, and a few kill anyone who comes across the place they are sworn to protect. A few lives are nothing when weighed against the life of the world, after all.\\nCreating: Druids, shamans, barbarians, rangers, and wardens are most likely to become primal guardians. They are already attuned to the primal spirits, and they can easily see the worth in defending a place where nature still flowers. Likewise, rangers and preservers-including sorcerers, wizards, and fey pact warlocks-are often close to nature and dedicated to its defense. However, the primal spirits sometimes move through unexpected heroes.\"},{\"@name\":\"Mark of Thunder\",\"@type\":\"Power\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_12258\",\"@source\":\"Dark Sun Campaign Setting\",\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"You invoke the fading power of the world as you strike.\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Power Usage\",\"$\":\"Encounter\"},{\"@name\":\"Display\",\"$\":\"Primal Guardian Attack\"},{\"@name\":\"Keywords\",\"$\":\"Primal, Thunder, Weapon\"},{\"@name\":\"Action Type\",\"$\":\"Standard Action\"},{\"@name\":\"Attack Type\",\"$\":\"Melee weapon\"},{\"@name\":\"Target\",\"$\":\"One creature\"},{\"@name\":\"Attack\",\"$\":\"Primary ability vs. AC\"},{\"@name\":\"Hit\",\"$\":\"1[W] + ability modifier thunder damage.\\nIncrease damage to 2[W] + ability modifier at 11th level.\\nIncrease damage to 3[W] + ability modifier at 21st level.\"},{\"@name\":\"Effect\",\"$\":\"You mark the target until the end of your next turn.\\nUntil the mark ends, if the target makes an attack that does not include you, it takes 5 thunder damage.\\nLevel 11: 10 thunder damage.\\nLevel 21: 15 thunder damage.\"},{\"@name\":\"Class\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_THEME_661\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\"},{\"@name\":\"Power Type\",\"$\":\"Attack\"}]},{\"@name\":\"Sandstep\",\"@type\":\"Power\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_12259\",\"@source\":\"Dark Sun Campaign Setting\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"ID_INTERNAL_CATEGORY_UTILITY,ID_INTERNAL_CATEGORY_ENCOUNTER_USAGE,ID_FMP_CLASS_0,ID_FMP_CATEGORY_33,ID_INTERNAL_CATEGORY_MOVE_ACTION,2\"},\"Prereqs\":{\"$\":\"ID_FMP_THEME_661\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"In a swirl of wind-driven sand, you move across the battlefield, and the sand obscures you and nearby allies.\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Power Usage\",\"$\":\"Encounter\"},{\"@name\":\"Display\",\"$\":\"Primal Guardian Utility 2\"},{\"@name\":\"Keywords\",\"$\":\"Primal\"},{\"@name\":\"Action Type\",\"$\":\"Move Action\"},{\"@name\":\"Attack Type\",\"$\":\"Personal\"},{\"@name\":\"Effect\",\"$\":\"You shift 3 squares.

They form a privileged meritocracy of individuals who serve as the sorcerer-king's eyes, ears, and mouth among the populace-and, as circumstances require, the heavy hand of crushing tyranny. Given broad discretion to enforce the king's will as they see fit, templars are often brutal and corrupt, using their positions to wring ruinous taxes and bribes from all who fall under their power. A sorcerer-king doesn't care about templars being corrupt, as long as they keep the city in good order.\\n\\tTemplars commonly enjoy broad powers to arrest wrongdoers, impose fines, and command soldiers or city guards to do their bidding in their home cities. Of course, higher-ranking templars can countermand these orders, so a low-ranking templar can't just commandeer the half-giants guarding a city gate and march off into the desert with them-he would have to appeal to his superiors to approve his mission and request that guards be assigned to his command. Likewise, templars of a particular city-state have no civic authority in other cities or in places not under the direct rule of their king. Though the civic powers granted to templars are formidable in their own right, templars are not simply bureaucrats-many are also formidable spellcasters, sanctioned to wield the terrible magic of the sorcerer-kings in the pursuit of their duties. In many cities templars are trained in arcane magic in formal academies and are bestowed with the ability to call upon their sorcerer-king's magical might through lengthy pacts.\\n\\tThe exact ranks and customs of the templar hierarchy vary widely from city to city. In Balic, templars are known as praetors and are elected to their positions (although a few elections end in unexpected upsets). The templars of Nibenay are exclusively female and are ceremonially wedded to the sorcererking. In Draj, templars are known as the Priests of the Moon and are charged with observing the civic worship of the king Tectuktitlay, who claims to be a god. Notwithstanding specific customs, all templars constitute a powerful, wealthy social class within their cities-a social class highly invested in keeping each sorcerer-king the supreme master of his or her city-state.\\n\\tMost templars revel in their positions and ruthlessly exploit the weak and the poor. However, a few are patriots who are truly concerned with what's best for their city and their fellow citizens. Some are reformers who seek to moderate the excesses of the system, and a rare handful are rebels seeking to effect change from within. Heroic templars likely hold these convictions.\\nCreating: All templars are members of the templar hierarchy and have some skill in the use of arcane magic-especially magic that is useful in compelling obedience or punishing lawbreakers. However, a templar need not be a member of a spellcasting class.

Cells of this cabal are located across the Tyr Region, mostly within the city-states. Each cell is independent and does not answer to any central authority. Leaders of each cell oversee and train a network of warriors, spies, and other capable agents-especially those who use arcane power.\\n\\tAll Veiled Alliance activities are directed toward the protection of preserving and the downfall of defiling. Although individual members might take up other tasks, the organization holds no other purpose as more important. The boldest of these aims is direct opposition to the sorcerer-kings. The Alliance is therefore a rebel movement-the only rebel movement worth speaking of in some cities. As such, members of the Veiled Alliance are eagerly hunted by the templars and agents of every surviving sorcerer-king and those who wish to curry their favor.\\n\\tAny preserver who comes to the attention of the Veiled Alliance earns a degree of aid. Membership is another matter. A potential recruit must be trustworthy and gain sponsorship of an existing member.\\n\\tThe Veiled Alliance holds the following tenets:\\n\\t• Protect the path of arcane preserving, its practitioners, and those who support preservers-especially the Veiled Alliance itself. Teach, aid, and liberate preservers and their allies. Do nothing that brings danger to a preserver's door.\\n\\t• Defilers are abominations that steal that which rightly belongs to everyone. In their weakness, they ruin the land and bring hostile attention to those who use arcane magic properly. Convert a defiler to the right path, or thwart and destroy the defiler without revealing the Alliance.\\n\\t• The greatest defilers, the sorcerer-kings, must be brought down. Only they have the power to destroy our path.\\nCreating: Most Veiled Alliance characters are preservers-sorcerers, wizards, and occasionally warlocks who have sworn never to defile and to do everything in their power to protect fellow preservers and safeguard knowledge that otherwise might pass from the world. However, not all Veiled Alliance members are primarily spellcasters. It's not unusual for an Alliance cell to include a sprinkling of psions, ardents, and other people of psionic talent, as well as spies and guards who have no magical talent at all.

Nomadic tribes roam the stony barrens and crisscross the sandy wastes as they follow kank herds or seek out new water sources. Owing no allegiance to any but themselves, they are the only Athasians (other than the recently freed people of Tyr) who know freedom's sweet taste. Many nomadic tribes have rejected the city-states for generations, surviving despite the hardships by learning the desert's secrets and mastering the survival techniques needed to provide the bare essentials.\\n\\tIn addition to those who are born to the nomadic life, there is no shortage of fugitives from the cities who hope to join them. Deserters, escaped slaves, and other refugees flee their homelands and the fate they would face if they stayed, preferring to risk their lives in the certain hardship and probable death the wastelands promise. Some find new homes alongside the nomadic tribes. Others go it alone, becoming hermits. But the desert claims most, with thirst, hunger, and exposure taking their toll until nothing remains but a slow, lingering death. Those who survive this grim test of survival are the toughest, the strongest, and the most willing to do what they must to meet whatever struggle they face.\\n\\tThe sorcerer-kings loathe the wasteland nomads, seeing them as nothing more than rabble and brigands who thieve and murder to make ends meet. In their eyes, the nomads are a cancer, weakening the sorcerer-kings' legitimate governments. Nomad tribes must contend not only with the environment, but also with the city-states' armies and patrols, which range the lands to round up new slaves to toil or fight or die, depending on the templar who seizes them. For this reason, and of course the never-ending quest for food and water, nomads must stay on the move.\\nCreating: You come from the deadly lands beyond the Seven Cities, and you derive power from the primal energy that still thrives in those regions. Barbarians, seekers, and other primal characters are common among the wasteland nomads, but heroes of any power source can emerge from the deserts of Athas. Rangers and rogues rely on their tricks and talents for survival. Monks appreciate the solitude of the wild. Ardents, battleminds, and psions perfect their mental disciplines away from the rule of the sorcerer-kings.\"},{\"@name\":\"Wasteland Fury\",\"@type\":\"Power\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_12360\",\"@source\":\"Dark Sun Campaign Setting\",\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"You catch the merciless sun's cruel radiance in your weapon and redirect it to dazzle your foe, covering your movement.\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Power Usage\",\"$\":\"Encounter\"},{\"@name\":\"Display\",\"$\":\"Wasteland Nomad Attack\"},{\"@name\":\"Keywords\",\"$\":\"Primal, Weapon\"},{\"@name\":\"Action Type\",\"$\":\"Standard Action\"},{\"@name\":\"Attack Type\",\"$\":\"Melee or Ranged weapon\"},{\"@name\":\"Effect\",\"$\":\"If you use this power while you are not adjacent to any of your allies, you can shift 1 square before or after the attack.\"},{\"@name\":\"Target\",\"$\":\"One creature\"},{\"@name\":\"Attack\",\"$\":\"Primary ability vs. AC\"},{\"@name\":\"Hit\",\"$\":\"1[W] + ability modifier damage.

Without formal training, these wilders manifest blunt, simple disciplines. Though well-trained savants scoff at the crudeness of the wilders' techniques, they are well aware of how powerful an unleashed mind brimming with psionic energy can be. Some wilders create bursts of fire or magical force, making their thoughts incarnate. Others batter through their enemies' mental defenses and cause grievous psionic anguish. A wilder isn't limited solely to outward manifestations of power, though. Many first learn how to alter their own bodies to make them far tougher, quicker, or stronger than normal. Wilders are most potent when they harness “psychic surges,” brief flashes of psionic energy that ripple through their minds and temporarily heighten their psionic abilities.\\n\\tIn the city-states, people see wilders as dangerous and unreliable. All too often an untrained wilder uses his or her ability against unsuspecting neighbors, or loses control of a power barely held in check-with disastrous consequences. In many cities, templars scour the children of nobles and commoners alike for signs of psionic power, and see to it that these discoveries are carefully trained to control their gifts and guard against disaster. Outside the cities, it's a different story. The psychic surges that wilders manifest are simply another advantage in the fight for survival in the savage lands outside the sorcererkings' domains. Each tribe treasures any wilders that appear within its ranks. As long as they help out, they're treated well.\\n\\tBecoming a wilder requires no formal training. In fact, trying to control and develop psychic surges can cause those powers to function poorly. A wilder might practice blasting rocks to learn how to manifest his or her inherent disciplines quickly and in the right spot, but that's all there is to it. Concentration is vital to a wilder, but mentors and formulas are worthless.\\nCreating: Anyone who manifests natural psionic ability without needing training could be a wilder. Wilders appear in all places and among all social strata. Your character might be a slave or a gladiator who has unnatural durability and stamina, a noble who got a head start on your psionic education by using your psychic surge, or a tribal leader who won a high place among your people by demonstrating your psionic powers.\"},{\"@name\":\"Psychic Surge\",\"@type\":\"Power\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_12375\",\"@source\":\"Dark Sun Campaign Setting\",\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"You unleash a psychic shock wave at your enemy, hoping to harness its energy on your next attack.\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Power Usage\",\"$\":\"Encounter\"},{\"@name\":\"Display\",\"$\":\"Wilder Attack\"},{\"@name\":\"Keywords\",\"$\":\"Implement, Psionic, Psychic\"},{\"@name\":\"Action Type\",\"$\":\"Standard Action\"},{\"@name\":\"Attack Type\",\"$\":\"Ranged 10\"},{\"@name\":\"Target\",\"$\":\"One creature\"},{\"@name\":\"Attack\",\"$\":\"Primary ability vs. Reflex\"},{\"@name\":\"Hit\",\"$\":\"1d8 + ability modifier psychic damage, and your attacks against the target before the end of your next turn can score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20.\\nIncrease damage to 2d8 + ability modifier at 11th level.\\nIncrease damage to 3d8 + ability modifier at 21st level.\"},{\"@name\":\"Class\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_THEME_676\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\"},{\"@name\":\"Power Type\",\"$\":\"Attack\"}]},{\"@name\":\"Wilder's Armor\",\"@type\":\"Power\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_12376\",\"@source\":\"Dark Sun Campaign Setting\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"ID_INTERNAL_CATEGORY_UTILITY,ID_INTERNAL_CATEGORY_ENCOUNTER_USAGE,ID_FMP_CLASS_0,ID_FMP_CATEGORY_35,ID_INTERNAL_CATEGORY_MINOR_ACTION,2\"},\"Prereqs\":{\"$\":\"ID_FMP_THEME_676\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"You instinctually reinforce your skin with psionic plates as strong as chitin.\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Power Usage\",\"$\":\"Encounter\"},{\"@name\":\"Display\",\"$\":\"Wilder Utility 2\"},{\"@name\":\"Keywords\",\"$\":\"Psionic\"},{\"@name\":\"Action Type\",\"$\":\"Minor Action\"},{\"@name\":\"Attack Type\",\"$\":\"Personal\"},{\"@name\":\"Effect\",\"$\":\"You gain a +2 power bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn.

Slave bones litter their alleys. Slave blood makes mud in the dust of their streets. Almost everywhere you go in the city-states you see someone with a yoke around the neck and eyes cast toward the ground. Tyr presents the only exception, but Tyr has depended upon the labor of slaves just as much as any other city. Even it sells criminals into slavery beyond its walls. How long can such “freedom” last?\\n\\tSlaves have always been a part of Athasian society. A harsh world calls for harsh justice. Those who cannot obey the laws that protect all or who are not smart enough to bow before those stronger than themselves do not deserve the water it takes to keep them alive. People become slaves by angering or offending those more powerful than themselves. A slave might have owed a debt, stolen a crust of bread, or not bowed low or fast enough when a person of importance passed. Citizens are declared slaves for owning items desired by nobles, for being captured instead of killed during war, and for knowing information above their station. Those born to slaves are slaves owned by the mother's master. After all, the master lost work from the mother during pregnancy and must pay for the child's care. Such a child owes the master labor equal to the period of time until it can do the work of a full adult, and by then it has no doubt done something to warrant its continued slavery. Even the kindest master realizes that a child raised in slavery is ill equipped for freedom and would likely die shortly after release. Though a slave lives a harsh life with no security, a master must provide for a slave's needs or accept the loss of that investment.\\n\\tOnce declared a slave, a person becomes property. Slaves change hands like money. They are won and lost in bets, sold at auction, and brought to market. Slave owners with slaves that have specialized skills or unusual attributes seek out buyers with particular needs. A slave owner can do what he or she likes with a slave, and it's no concern of anyone else. Masters expect slaves to work incredibly hard to earn their keep or face death in the arena, a quick execution, or whatever other cruelty the master dreams up.\\n\\tFew slaves even dream of escape. The declaration of slavery is like a death sentence in its finality. Even if the leather and bone manacles are broken, even if the guards are evaded or killed, the rest of the world hates and fears an escaped slave. Those who aid an escaped slave-even unwittingly-can expect to become slaves themselves. Those who turn them in often receive a reward worth as much as half the slave's value. Only Tyr offers a slim hope of sanctuary, and if a slave has angered the master enough, many ways exist to take someone from that city.\\n\\tAn escaped slave's only hope is to see freedom as a rebirth. Old haunts, one-time friends, even family-all need to be avoided for fear of being recognized and turned in. Hide the brand, disguise the tattoo, cover up the scars, explain the calluses away-successful escaped slaves do all this and more. Escaped slaves must take up a new name, a new history, and if one can manage it, a new appearance. Some escaped slaves do all this, but the strong will and sharp mind such a life requires often drives successful escaped slaves back toward their former owners, exchanging one master for another: revenge.\\nCreating: Some slaves are sent to the arena as gladiators, but escaped slaves likely served their owners in some other capacity. Some toiled beneath the burning sun while others groaned in the shade as they bore fat masters on palanquins. An escaped slave might have belonged to a merchant, a noble, or even a sorcerer-king. An escaped slave might have fled from the watchful eye of an artisan who owns no others or from the vast retinue of a plantation owner.\\n\\tRogues, bards, assassins, and others with a penchant for deceit make good choices for an escaped slave. The theme powers present useful abilities for melee combatants, but those who seek to hide their skills and avoid melee attacks, such as arcane casters or bow-wielding characters, might find the escaped slave theme useful. As a heroic escaped slave, your character might have learned the abilities of his or her class powers after escaping. Alternatively, your character's class might represent who he or she was before becoming enslaved. Perhaps your character hid these talents while owned by another, or maybe you put your abilities to use for your former master.\"},{\"@name\":\"Hidden Strike\",\"@type\":\"Power\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_13431\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 390\",\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"You disguise your movements so that no one suspects you are at fault.\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Power Usage\",\"$\":\"Encounter\"},{\"@name\":\"Display\",\"$\":\"Escaped Slave Feature\"},{\"@name\":\"Keywords\",\"$\":\"Martial\"},{\"@name\":\"Action Type\",\"$\":\"Free Action\"},{\"@name\":\"Attack Type\"},{\"@name\":\"Trigger\",\"$\":\"You make an attack\"},{\"@name\":\"Effect\",\"$\":\"Make a Bluff check.

They are keen observers of the physical world, and many alchemists have extensive interests in fields of knowledge ranging from astronomy to zoology.\\n  Although many wizards find the study of alchemy rewarding, not all alchemists are wizards. Alchemy does not require the casting of spells or the use of arcane power; the reagents provide all the magic that is necessary to create alchemical effects. Anybody who has a reliable formula, the necessary ingredients, and the specialized knowledge to follow exacting instructions precisely can create alchemical substances and devices. For example, fighters and paladins sometimes study alchemy for its usefulness in siegecraft and military engineering, and rogues find many uses for smoke bombs, lock-eating acids, and sleeping powders.\\n  Experiment and experience are the alchemist's path to understanding, and the vast majority of alchemists maintain a large laboratory stocked with a huge variety of tools and reagents. Alchemical laboratories are expensive, so most alchemists seek out a wealthy sponsor, such as a royal patron, or a civic commission. In some lands, sponsorship of a famous alchemist is a point of great pride, and rival cities or courts seek to entice alchemists of renown to establish workshops in the realm. Alchemists who have no royal patrons support their studies and experiments by producing mixtures that are useful to other artisans, or substances that have military (or criminal) applications. Unsponsored alchemists have less time or fewer resources available for pure experimentation, but they're also not hampered by meddling or inconvenient requests from the lord or lady holding the purse strings.\\n  Creating: Adventuring alchemists have little opportunity to establish large laboratories or conduct lengthy, involved experiments. However, they have a great advantage over alchemists who are settled in workshops: They frequently encounter rare and unusual materials that more sedentary alchemists have a hard time coming by, so they can create potent mixtures and substances with much smaller samples and simpler processes than alchemists who rely on more mundane materials. Armed with a \\\"traveling workshop\\\"-a large case filled with small samples of useful reagents, portable instruments, and working notes-an adventuring alchemist can prepare almost anything an ordinary alchemist might brew up in a full-sized workshop. Adventuring alchemists naturally keep their eyes open for interesting materials, and they constantly restock their cases with quick scrapings or samples from the things they see as they go about their explorations.\\n\\t  To make use of the optional powers of this theme, you must have an alchemy case.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Alchemist Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3866\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 399\",\"Prereqs\":{\"$\":\"Alchemist\"},\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"Gain the Alchemist Feat, learn a Starting Alchemy Forumla, and you can create one alchemical item that you know the formula for of your level or lower at no cost at the end of a short rest.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\",\"$\":\"1\"}],\"rules\":{\"grant\":{\"@name\":\"ID_FMP_FEAT_652\",\"@type\":\"Feat\"},\"textstring\":{\"@name\":\"Free Rituals\",\"@value\":\"* As an Alchemist, you are entitled to one 1st-level alchemic formula to begin your career.

Anyone who lacks for humanoid companionship might adopt an animal as a friend and traveling companion, but animal masters aren't just collectors of pets-they're expert trainers and handlers who establish practical partnerships with their animal companions. Animals possess crucial senses and abilities that humans (and other civilized people) lack, and by working closely with a well-trained partner, animal masters gain the benefit of these senses and talents too.\\n  Although some who work with animals train large, ferocious creatures as battle companions, most animal masters work with common animals that are easily domesticated. Their companions are friendly toward or tolerate humans, and they have much more ability to learn complicated tricks and behaviors than truly wild animals do. Heroes interested in keeping panthers, bears, wolves, or other large carnivores to tear their foes to pieces belong in the druid or ranger classes, where they can learn the appropriate powers and acquire dangerous wild beasts to aid them in battle.\\n  Creating: Animal masters include members of most classes. Fighters, paladins, and other warriors find that the keen senses of loyal animals are very useful for avoiding ambushes and keeping watch over camp at night. Other adventurers keep animals for less noble purposes; some rogues train small, clever animals as effective burglars or thieves. However, rangers are the most common animal masters. These individuals are often loners, and they have a knack for befriending all sorts of nondangerous animals.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Animal Master Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3869\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 399\",\"Prereqs\":{\"$\":\"Animal Master\"},\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"Choose an animal to be your animal minion.

Natural talent and a quick mind are only the bare beginning of being able to wield the arcane arts. Achieving true mastery requires personal dedication and self-discipline, rigorous training, and access to libraries full of ancient grimoires and crumbling scrolls. In many places no special organizations or traditions exist to guide wizards and other arcane spellcasters along their way; magic-users come to their full powers and wield their spells as they see fit. But in other lands, magic is regarded as too important-or too dangerous-to be left in the hands of the self-taught dabblers. In these lands, magic is taught and practiced by members of special orders, guilds, societies, brotherhoods, and cabals who jealously guard access to their powers and seek to control their use.\\n  Arcane orders arise for many reasons. Some exist for the purpose of preserving arcane traditions and instructing new spellcasters in arcane powers. Others organize the efforts of their members in the service of a worthy (or sometimes not so worthy) cause. For example, the Order of the Golden Flame is sworn to serve the crown of Cernall, and its members are granted extensive authority as royal officers. The Ruathar Eldoni is an order of eladrin wizards dedicated to the destruction of demons, its members traveling throughout the world and beyond it to deal with demonic incursions wherever they appear. The Emerald Orb is a meddlesome cabal whose members believe that wizards should rule over lesser mortals, and they work to gain influence over important rulers or to establish open magocracies. Some orders are large, formal hierarchies in which members are expected to obey the orders of their superiors, whileothers are small fellowships in which no one member is considered superior to his or her fellows.\\n  An arcane order might operate openly or exist as a hidden society. Members of openly active orders typically proclaim their allegiance with a highly recognizable garment or symbol; for example, wizards of the Golden Flame wear a richly embroidered yellow cloak, and members of the Ruathar Eldoni often wear a silver star-shaped brooch or clasp. Other orders favor such identifiers as tattoos, unique hairstyles or grooming, or implements of a particular design. Members of secret orders avoid any outwardly distinguishing signs, of course, but often have secret signs they can use to prove their identity to others of their group-for instance, a pendant worn under one's shirt, a ring that isn't very obvious to a casual viewer, or a brand hidden beneath robes.\\n  Creating: Most order adepts are, of course, wizards or warlocks. Members of both classes rarely appear in the same order, but both have traditions of gathering in secret societies that share a common vision. In addition, many orders include individuals who supplement their studies in arcane magic with other talents. Clerics devoted to gods of magic or battle mages who find that the swords and armor of the fighter are the tools that suit them best can be members in good standing of an arcane order. Sometimes members of other classes begin their careers as aspiring wizards before abandoning their studies. For the rest of their lives they carry the memories (and perhaps disappointments) of their youthful studies, and still find uses for the little bit of arcane magic they did learn before they left or were dismissed.\"},{\"@name\":\"Order Adept Starting Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3872\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 399\",\"Prereqs\":{\"$\":\"Order Adept\"},\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"Gain the argent rain power\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\",\"$\":\"1\"},{\"@name\":\"_DisplayPowers\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14123\"}],\"rules\":{\"grant\":{\"@name\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14123\",\"@type\":\"Power\"}},\"$\":\"Each arcane brotherhood or wizardly order has its own signature battle tactic.

Stories tell of foolish apprentices stealing peeks at books that should not be opened, fumbling love charms, or botching transmutations by treating dangerous magic as a clever toy. Other tales recall clever apprentices who come up with just the right spell to save a village while their masters are away, or boldly putting their lessons to good use as they set out in search of adventure. Whether they turn out to be rash or resourceful, wizards' apprentices begin their careers with a priceless advantage: the personal instruction and tutelage of an experienced master.\\n  In exchange for the privilege of learning magic, wizards' apprentices normally spend years engaged in whatever drudgery and chores their masters deem fitting. A typical human wizard's apprentice begins his or her studies around the age of eleven or twelve and remains in the master's household for five or six years. Experienced spellcasters can take on apprentices for a variety of reasons: to share their appreciation of the art, to repay the work of their own masters by instructing a worthy student, or to tutor a young noble. Surprisingly, many of the most reclusive or suspicious-even evil-spellcasters take on apprentices; some regard it as their duty to pass along their learning, some hope to shape talented young mages into future allies (or minions), and others desire an audience to witness the brilliance of their schemes. Evil masters are often callous or exacting, but only the stupidest are actively sadistic toward their apprentices; after all, it's not wise to share secrets of power with someone you've caused to hate you.\\n  Adventuring wizards' apprentices are usually young adults whose training is more or less complete. They no longer live in their masters' households, and they aren't obligated to wash floors or scrub pots between lessons. Assuming such an individual parted from his or her master on good terms, the apprentice has at least one knowledgeable patron willing to offer advice and assistance in important matters. Many wizards' apprentices retain their loyalty to their masters throughout their lifetimes, even if they surpass their masters' achievements. Apprentices who were taught by particularly powerful or famous masters can serve as agents and allies of those mentors, and they see themselves as the appointed guardians of a long and honored tradition. Just as noble families have ancestral lines going back centuries, many famous spell casters likewise come from lines of apprentice-master relationships tracing back to famous wizards or sorcerers of old.\\n  Creating: Most apprentices are arcane spellcasters-warlocks or wizards. Both classes boast long traditions of passing on knowledge to a single chosen student at a time to ensure that only those who prove themselves competent and responsible are taught the ways of magic. However, many would-be students of the arcane choose not to follow in their masters' footsteps. For example, a young ne'er-do-well might toil over lessons and chores in the home of the town's sorcerer, only to abandon his or her master and take up a career as a rogue who happens to know a fair bit of arcane magic from years of indentured servitude. Wealthy nobles often arrange tutors for their children, providing the basics of an arcane education even if the youngsters turn to other pursuits when they become adults. Almost anyone might have studied magic before he or she became an adventurer.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Wizard's Apprentice Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3875\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 399\",\"Prereqs\":{\"$\":\"Wizard's Apprentice\"},\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"Gain the color orb power\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\",\"$\":\"1\"},{\"@name\":\"_DisplayPowers\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14127\"}],\"rules\":{\"grant\":{\"@name\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14127\",\"@type\":\"Power\"}},\"$\":\"You have mastered a useful attack spell that many wizards' apprentices learn early in their studies.

Although some are devout wielders of divine power, many have no magical abilities at all; the term \\\"ordained priest\\\" in this context means someone who holds the social position or occupation of being an ordained official of the faith. For example, typical village priests have no powers comparable to the attack and utility prayers of adventuring clerics. They hold a different sort of power: the deference of their neighbors, the trust of the authorities, and the respect of the great majority of the citizenry who rely on their counsel and good judgment. Ordained priests might serve as teachers, soldiers, confessors, advisors, students, magistrates, or powerful rulers, but whatever their role in society, they inspire and influence ordinary people to live up to the standards of their faith.\\n  Ordained priests enjoy a bewildering variety of preferred titles. Depending on the land in which they're found and the faith to which they belong, they might be known as curates, elders, friars, imams, lamas, prelates, shepherds, rectors, or vicars. In some realms, temples are huge, powerful states within the nation, ruling over wide estates guarded by armies of temple guards. Ordained priests in rich, influential hierarchies such as these might have duties or titles that have little to do with ministering to commoners, and instead they could wield authority as judges, lawkeepers, and bureaucrats. However, most faiths in the mortal world are smaller organizations that rarely have much influence outside their own realm or kingdom.\\n  Creating: Although ordained priests aren't always clerics (or paladins, or adventurers of any sort), it's not unusual for clerics or other heroes to be ordained priests. Ordained priests are educated by the standards of their homelands, plus they are influential and responsible. When difficult challenges or threats arise, rulers often consult with local priests and seek their advice about how to proceed. Some ordained priests are content to offer their counsel, but others more inclined to action might set out to solve problems personally, eventually taking up a career in adventuring. Naturally, adventuring ordained priests are often clerics. Druids also serve as members of the priesthood in some cultures and are a good fit for this theme. Rogues or fighters might also serve as ordained priests, employing guile or strong sword arms in the service of their faith.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Ordained Priest Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3878\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 399\",\"Prereqs\":{\"$\":\"Ordained Priest\"},\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"Choose smiting symbol or shining symbol.

Scholars study the lore of ancient times, collecting old texts and ferreting out forgotten secrets. They seek to preserve the memories of bygone days and pass along to future generations the important lessons the past offers. As with any dungeon-delving adventurers, they are keenly interested in dormant perils and lost treasures, but scholars are just as interested in the most ordinary details of ancient realms and events. To scholars, knowledge is its own reward.\\n  Not all cultures or societies value the musty old tales of ancient days. For many people, the study of history-or simple literacy-is an extravagance. Scholars are highly specialized professionals, and their services are not in great demand. The typical frontier town or farming village has no library or formal schooling. As a result, scholars are found only in places where books and records are collected. Large cities sometimes feature vaults or libraries dedicated to scholarship, and they might have colleges or guilds of scholars who study in them. However, large collections of books are more typically the prized possessions of temples dedicated to deities of knowledge and civilization (such as Ioun or Erathis), or of powerful noble families. Most scholars are therefore sponsored or supported by a temple or patron, and they seek to repay their benefactors by adding to their collections throughout their careers.\\n  Creating a Scholar: Adventuring scholars are most often wizards, since the study of the arcane arts appeals to the same sort of intelligent, meticulous individual that scholarship does. Arcane secrets are buried in ancient tomes and hidden in myth and legend much like the secrets of history and other fields of learning. Clerics also make good scholars-especially clerics devoted to deities of knowledge or magic. Any cleric of Ioun or Erathis is likely something of a scholar already. Warlocks also know the value of ancient lore, but in their traditions, knowledge is regarded as something to hoard and conceal; most warlocks are cryptic and obscure at best. Fighters, rogues, paladins, and rangers are not likely to follow the scholar's path, preferring action to contemplation. However, some heroes might have been raised to be scholars only to choose a different walk of life later. For example, a young scholar lured by the idea of unearthing forgotten hoards might become an exceptionally well-educated rogue who specializes in plundering ancient crypts\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Scholar Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3882\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 399\",\"Prereqs\":{\"$\":\"Scholar\"},\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"You know one additional language chosen from Draconic, Dwarven, and Elven.

They might call themselves astrologers, fortunetellers, readers, augurs, diviners, or soothsayers, and each employs a favored technique for prognostication. Many seers choose to complicate their viewings with flamboyant mummery designed to impress ordinary people and perhaps conceal the important secrets of their trade. But despite the confusing mystical trappings, seers aren't frauds. Their second sight is a real and powerful gift, even if it is fickle at times.\\n  The ability to anticipate success or failure in great endeavors, to determine the most auspicious times to embark on risky ventures, or to read the secret motives of others is a valuable edge. Naturally, wealthy patrons seek out famous and successful seers so that they can gain advantage over their rivals. Retained as permanent advisors and paid generously for their services, these kept seers are at the top of their profession. Kept seers enjoy unusual access to those they serve, and they can become entangled in the petty rivalries and battles for influence that pervade most courts and noble households. To minimize such entanglements, some rulers choose to sequester their magical advisors, keeping them out of the reach of courtiers or rivals who might harbor ambitious schemes. Other seers embrace their role as important figures in the court. Competent seers with this sort of position are placed well to do great good, but they can also do serious harm if they provide their masters with inept advice or engage in disloyal behavior. After all, a \\\"trusted\\\" wizard has deposed more than one king.\\n  Seers who have not yet attracted a wealthy patron or established a reputation for success settle for a meager living catering to commoners, casting fortunes for a few coppers or silvers at a turn. Ordinary people often seek the advice of augurs and diviners when contemplating major business decisions, choosing a time to travel, arranging marriages, naming a child, or seeking explanations for some sort of misfortune. In a bustling city, well-respected seers with a wealthy clientele can make a comfortable living. Seers from small or backward towns might be little better than peddlers and beggars, hard-pressed to feed themselves from day to day-a situation that makes it hard to convince potential customers that one's powers offer useful insights. Adventuring seers fall somewhere between the extremes of royal advisor or marketplace fortune-teller; they rarely settle down in the service of a single patron, but in time their spreading fame ensures that many will come to seek their advice.\\n  Creating a Seer: To invoke useful visions, seers require natural talent (their gift, whatever form it takes) and ability with the magical arts. Minor spells help many seers to direct their ability. Consequently, adventuring seers are usually wizards or warlocks. Some techniques for readings and visions are divine in nature rather than arcane, so clerics are also common as seers. Cleric seers are often revered as prophets or interpreters of dreams whose visions are gifts of the gods. Seers of other classes are uncommon at best, although a few brazen rogues have been known to use the seer's trappings to implement schemes and scams of all sorts.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Seer Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3885\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 399\",\"Prereqs\":{\"$\":\"Seer\"},\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"You gain the cast fortune power.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\",\"$\":\"1\"},{\"@name\":\"_DisplayPowers\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14141\"}],\"rules\":{\"grant\":{\"@name\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14141\",\"@type\":\"Power\"}},\"$\":\"You can perform a minor divination, read omens, cast a horoscope, or use another method of prediction to determine whether fortune favors an individual on this day.

A chevalier's personal honor is his or her most treasured possession; it is far better to die with honor than to live without it. Chivalric codes vary from race to race and culture to culture, but most agree on a number of noble virtues that all chevaliers should aspire to: courage, fairness, mercy, justice, loyalty, honesty, charity, piety, moderation, and gallantry.\\n  Although chevaliers strive to cultivate all the chivalric virtues, the most important elements of their code revolve around behavior on the field of battle. Honor demands that chevaliers seek out the most worthy foes on the field to defeat in a fair fight. Chevaliers aren't under any requirement to stand and die against superior foes-but they must stand as long as they hold out any hope for victory, and they need to execute a fighting retreat rather than flee in panic if the battle is hopeless. Likewise, chevaliers strive to fight fairly. Flanking foes or attacking dazed enemies is fair enough, especially if the enemy has the advantage of numbers, but performing a coup de grace or attacking a stunned foe is not honorable. Some chevaliers might wait for enemies that have fallen prone to stand again before resuming combat, or to permit a respite if a foe requests one. Of course, enemies who refuse to fight in a chivalrous manner fall outside the protections of honor and should be dealt with in the most expedient manner available.\\n  Chevaliers frequently come from well-born families. Many chivalrous traditions arise from the requirements of elite military social classes, such as heavily armored cavalry and highly trained sword fighters. Acquiring the specialized equipment and years of training needed to serve as their realms' most highly prized warriors-whether that warrior ideal is a human knight, a dwarf giant-slayer, or an eladrin bladesinger-is never cheap or easy. In some lands, aspiring heroes aren't permitted to become chevaliers unless they can prove their noble birth and thus their right to claim the privileges of knighthood, but in most places low-born warriors of skill and personal integrity can win their spurs through the sponsorship of royal patrons or their performance on the battlefield. No one denies that chevaliers are prone to more than a little haughtiness toward those they perceive as their social inferiors, but even the prickliest among them are conscious of their obligation to protect the weak and the poor from those who would oppress them.\\nCreating a Chevalier: A number of chevaliers are fighters (and most of those are knights), but other heroes also feel drawn to this gallant path. Many paladins and warpriests become chevaliers, dedicating themselves to upholding the chivalric virtues as they confront evil. Among elves and eladrin, ranger chevaliers aren't uncommon; elven chivalry does not disdain ranged weapons or the use of magic. Likewise, tiefling hexblades sometimes become \\\"dark chevaliers,\\\" unleashing their warlock powers only against enemies who have demonstrated that nothing less will do.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Chevalier Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3888\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 399\",\"Prereqs\":{\"$\":\"Chevalier\"},\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"+5 power bonus to Athletics checks and Acrobatics checks to jump, swim, or hop down while mounted.

Although strength and fighting spirit are useful to guardians, most pride themselves on using their heads, not their hands. Guardians believe that the service they offer doesn't permit personal glory-seeking or needless risk-taking. If the causes or the people they protect can be defended only by head-on battle, then guardians do not hesitate to draw their weapons. On the other hand, if the best way to carry out a mission is to employ stealth or subterfuge, or flee the scene, so be it.\\n  A guardian's orders vary widely from realm to realm. Some exist to protect another group or organization, such as the high priests of a particular god, the members of a wizards' guild, or a family line harboring a great destiny or a magical legacy. Some are sworn to protect a rare or treasured site or item, such as the forge-flame burning eternally in the heart of a dwarven citadel, or a mighty artifact of good that a demon lord seeks so that it can destroy the item. A few guardian orders are mercenary squads of the highest quality, priding themselves on offering the best, most loyal protection that gold can buy. However, most guardians are sworn to the service of a kingdom or realm. They serve as bodyguards to the royal family and high-ranking members of court, protect the treasures and the secrets of the realm, and undertake missions of vital interest to the crown.\\nCreating a Guardian: Characters who specialize in melee combat make the best guardians. Fighters and paladins are naturally strong candidates for this theme, since they combine good close-combat capabilities with excellent durability-a vital characteristic, since guardians must be ready to take an arrow for their charges if that's what the situation demands. Militant clerics likewise become guardians on occasion, protecting their wards with wise counsel as well as strength of arms. Rogues and rangers can also do well as guardians, since they can be less obvious than more heavily armed characters, and they have talents for circumventing avoidable dangers rather than battling through them.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Guardian Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3891\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 399\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"You gain the guardian's counter power.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\",\"$\":\"1\"},{\"@name\":\"_DisplayPowers\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14149\"}],\"rules\":{\"grant\":{\"@name\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14149\",\"@type\":\"Power\"}},\"$\":\"Guardians require good melee combat skills, and they are expected to do their best to protect nearby allies caught up in the melee.

Their chapter houses are in many large cities, offering comfort and healing to those in need of it. However, Knight Hospitalers are most famous for their work out in frontier lands, where they aid travelers (especially religious pilgrims) who are in distress far from any other help. Fortified hospices stand near difficult mountain passes, at remote river crossings, and in lonely clearings in dark, monster-haunted forests. Many are the travelers whose lives have been saved by Knight Hospitalers watching over dangerous roads in the wilds.\\n  In addition to serving as healers and sponsoring almshouses and hospices throughout the land, Knight Hospitalers are valiant soldiers. Knight Hospitaler orders keep roads safe from bandits and monsters, especially routes used by pilgrims journeying to holy sites. They defend important shrines and protect high-ranking members of the priesthood. Finally, Knight Hospitaler orders are the backbone of many crusading armies seeking to confront great evils in far lands.\\n  Like chevaliers, Knight Hospitalers are seen as knights of a sort and are entitled to a number of privileges in most realms. They are responsible for maintaining estates and strongholds, overseeing justice in their demesnes, and marshaling companies of soldiers to protect the lands around their estates. However, they are loyal to religious leaders, not secular rulers. Knight Hospitaler commanders hold high ecclesiastic rank as well as knightly titles and estates. In practice, most Knight Hospitalers split their time between the estates for which they are personally responsible and the chapter houses or hospices of their order. Titles and estates are awarded on the basis of seniority and family influence, so low-ranking Knight Hospitalers rarely have estates of their own. Instead they serve as seneschals or lieutenants to landed Knight Hospitalers, swear fealty to the king or high nobles of the nearest realm, or take up arms in a crusade.\\nCreating a Knight Hospitaler: Clerics of any kind and paladins are the backbone of Knight Hospitaler orders. Armed with potent healing abilities, they are well equipped to carry out the sacred mission of their societies.

Some begin their stories as peasants, some as rough-and-ready homesteaders from frontier lands, and others as welloff townsfolk, but some heroes are born into privilege. Noble-born heroes enjoy opportunities and comforts that many commoners can only imagine, but if they are blessed with wealth and inf luence by the luck of being born to high station, then they are also obligated to do more with the gifts they have been given.\\n  The definition of nobility varies from land to land and race to race. In most realms, the aristocracy falls into three groups: low nobility, high nobility, and royalty. Low nobles include landed knights, squires, baronets, lairds, hidalgos, seigneurs, and other holders of minor titles and estates. Typically a low noble's lands rarely extend for more than a day's ride or include more than one good-sized town. Most low nobles owe allegiance to a nearby high noble, who might bear a title such as baron, count, duke, marquis, earl, landgrave, or prince. High nobles can be major powers, since they are wealthy enough to raise their own armies and are near-absolute rulers over the lands of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of low nobles. High nobles in turn owe their allegiance to the sovereign of their realm. Royal titles come in a bewildering variety, ranging from king or queen to archduke, high prince, tsar, khan, shah, or something even more exotic. Of course, the ranks of the nobility also include everyone in the titled landholder's family. A member of a noble family who isn't the actual titleholder is generally called lord or lady.\\n  An adventurer from a noble family is rarely the family's active titleholder or ruler. Governing and defending a fief is an important duty, and the affairs of the kingdom leave little time for dungeon delving and adventure seeking. Most noble heroes are therefore untitled lords or ladies who are closely related to a titleholder. A hero might be the heir apparent to the title of head of the family, standing only one heartbeat away from a noble seat, or he or she might be further removed from the order of succession, free to indulge a taste for adventure with little concern for ever becoming a baron, a duke, or a king.\\n  Regardless of whether they hold titles or might inherit them, nobles still enjoy a number of perquisites of their high stations. Common officials and lawkeepers can arrest or hinder nobles only in exceptional circumstances. Important people in nearby lands are careful to treat nobles with respect, even deference, for fear of offending a powerful family. Nobles are also wealthy by the standards of most people. As long as they're anywhere near home, nobles can afford fine meals, excellent lodgings, and sufficient allowances and stipends to maintain themselves in comfort.\\nCreating a noble: Noble heroes can be found in every character class. Naturally, knights are frequently born of noble families. Wizards can come from noble backgrounds, since noble families possess the means and the opportunity to arrange for promising youngsters who display an interest in magic to be tutored in the magical arts. Nobles blocked from inheriting titles by older siblings are encouraged to enter the clergy, and they might become clerics or paladins. Even a rogue could have an aristocratic origin; a street-savvy thief might be a troublemaker who became bored with a life of being pampered or a runaway seeking to avoid the duties of holding high rank.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Noble Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3897\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 399\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"You gain the noble presence power.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\",\"$\":\"1\"},{\"@name\":\"_DisplayPowers\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14159\"}],\"rules\":{\"grant\":{\"@name\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14159\",\"@type\":\"Power\"}},\"$\":\"Nobles are born to lead.

Formal exploration is not very common in the world; a few wealthy kingdoms and mercantile cities charter expeditions to distant lands or reward travelers who return home with descriptions of far-off places. Most explorers, however, are individuals whose interests or duties lead them to venture into places where other people rarely go. They can be hunters, scouts, pathfinders, merchants, or emissaries to distant realms. Pursuing their private interests or carrying out important missions entrusted to them leads these travelers into the wild places of the world.\\nMany explorers begin their adventures as professional treasure-seekers. Searching out legends about lost hoards, hidden artifacts, or unplundered tombs, they put their talents to use in locating the rich score that no one else has found. Other explorers are engaged in searches, quests, or missions that lead them to places no one has visited before. For example, an order of knights or wizards might charge its members with traveling the world to battle a specific threat. A few explorers are true wanderers-travelers who feel compelled to see for themselves what lies beyond the next ridge or to seek out legendary challenges. Fortune or fame is of little concern to these wanderers; they live to satisfy their personal curiosity or to measure themselves against the dangers they overcome.\\nRegardless of individual motivation, explorers must master a daunting set of skills if they hope to be successful. They must be tough and enduring, capable of traveling great distances over difficult terrain, and must have the ability to survive the worst extremes of weather. They must be expert beast hunters and foragers with a talent for living off the land no matter where they are, since they're not likely to find friendly inns or trading posts once they leave civilization behind. A knack for direction is indispensable; roads are nonexistent in the wilds, and missing an important landmark or choosing the wrong turn off a poorly marked trail might be a fatal mistake. Finally, explorers had better be ready to defend themselves from the attacks of vicious raiders and hungry monsters.\\nCreating an Explorer: The explorer theme works well with any character class. Rogues are drawn to this theme as treasureseekers; legends of vast hoards in lost cities or fantastic treasures hidden in deep caverns are the meat and drink of many bold rogues. Wizards take to the explorer's path for less materialistic reasons, drawn by the lure of knowledge and discovery. Rangers are perhaps the most iconic explorers. At home in the deepest wilderness, skilled in the hunt, capable and enduring, rangers are pathfinders and trackers of extraordinary skill.

Orphaned, abandoned, or mistreated as children, guttersnipes can grow into hard-bitten, cynical adults. Marked by the lower-class manners and speech patterns of the poorest quarters, guttersnipe heroes struggle to be seen as something more than the dregs of society. Guttersnipes live their lives under constant suspicion from the more fortunate people in the world. Most are seen as greedy, lying cutpurses, footpads, or ruffians who would slit a throat for a handful of silver pieces. Common people openly distrust them, constables and watch officers routinely harass or question them, and aristocrats are surrounded by watchful guards or counselors who make it a point to keep the riffraff, especially dangerous riffraff, away.\\nUnder this cloak of distrust, some guttersnipes choose to live down to others' expectations, nursing bitter grudges against their \\\"betters.\\\" Others desperately try to escape their poor origin by concealing their street manners and lack of education behind carefully rehearsed facades of gentility; they dread the day when someone sees through the disguise. Some happy-go-lucky souls choose not to be troubled by suspicions and slights, refusing to be defined by others' ill-informed judgments. Finally, benefactors who see potential in them pluck a lucky few guttersnipes out of the streets and give them a chance to make something of themselves. A powerful wizard might detect a spark of greatness in a street urchin and teach the boy or girl a few tricks; a compassionate priest might offer a poor child a chance to become an acolyte in a temple. As recounted in more than one legendary tale, guttersnipes are sometimes picked up from the streets by royalty or high nobles and adopted after doing some great service or showing tremendous pluck.\\nWhether a guttersnipe meets life with wry wit or scheming self-interest, every one is a survivor who excels in recognizing and seizing opportunity. Guttersnipes who through good fortune or hard work leave the streets behind to become wizards, clerics, or wards of nobles might not look or sound much like the beggar children they once were, but inside they still have the quick wits and daring that got them noticed in the first place.\\nCreating a Guttersnipe: Naturally, a great number of rogues are guttersnipes; growing up in the streets provides a perfect opportunity for learning the rogue's talents. Fighters, especially slayers, also fit this theme well. Guttersnipes of exceptional talent sometimes turn to magic and master the warlock's art, determined to earn respect through power. Beyond that, characters of any class could be plucked from the streets or succeed in their efforts to improve their circumstances. A guttersnipe is most likely a human, dwarf, halfling, drow, or tiefling, since the lowborn folk of these races are most likely to congregate in the sort of poor, desperate slums from which guttersnipes come.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Guttersnipe Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3903\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 399\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"You gain the running slash power.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\",\"$\":\"1\"},{\"@name\":\"_DisplayPowers\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14167\"}],\"rules\":{\"grant\":{\"@name\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14167\",\"@type\":\"Power\"}},\"$\":\"In the worst quarters of cities, packs of nearly feral guttersnipes pose a threat to careless passersby.

Capable warriors and spellcasters are always in demand, and the more desperately they're needed, the better paid they are. More than a few young heroes begin their careers by striking out in search of opportunities to turn their fighting skills into high-paying jobs. Although most people expect that mercenaries do only what they're paid to do, it's not unusual for a heroic mercenary to show a soft spot after coming across people in need who can't afford his or her services. It might not be good business, but one of the advantages of being unencumbered by loyalties and obligations is the ability to follow the dictates of one's conscience whenever they strike.\\nEach adventuring mercenary falls into one of two broad categories: retainer or freelancer. A retainer signs on with a patron, providing service in exchange for a regular stipend or salary. Nobles, merchants, and royal officials often find it useful to keep a small number of talented troubleshooters at their beck and call for escorting them during travels, guarding their homes or interests, or dealing sternly with rivals. Retainers are naturally expected to follow their employers' orders, but they spend less time looking for work.\\nA freelancer hires on for one specific job at a time or works on speculation-for example, hunting down outlaws who have prices on their heads or searching out prospective employers who have problems in need of fixing.\\nMercenaries might be more flexible in their standards than high-minded characters who serve others without thought of reward, but that doesn't mean they'll do anything for money. Heroic mercenaries won't hesitate to walk away from jobs that require them to murder, rob, or oppress commoners. Likewise, the best mercenaries pride themselves on their loyalty and professionalism even under difficult conditions. Any thug can take a paymaster's gold to swagger around and look capable when danger's far away, but honest mercenaries don't slink off into the shadows when called upon to earn their pay. Building a reputation for having standards and being reliable is the best way to impress future employers. Some mercenaries, however, are little more than brigands who are perfectly happy to earn a living through plundering and banditry if they can't find more respectable work that pays them well enough. Heroic mercenaries therefore face a good deal of suspicion and prejudice from people who expect sellswords to behave like thugs.\\nCreating a Mercenary: Characters of any class might call themselves mercenaries, or at least make a habit of choosing their quests based on the likely rewards. Rogues and fighters naturally fit the mercenary's approach to adventure, and they often flourish as sellswords. Clerics and paladins can be driven by higher ideals than pure self-interest, but a devout or pious individual might nonetheless fall in with a company of freebooters.\\nServing as voices of conscience and spiritual shepherds to their more worldly companions, they encourage their allies to take on causes that are both worthy and well paying. On the other hand, wizards can be every bit as avaricious as martial characters who sell their loyalties for gold. Ambitious nobles and powerful merchants find it useful to retain house wizards who can advise them on arcane matters, spy on rivals, and defend against the wizards employed by their rivals.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Mercenary Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3906\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 399\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"You gain the takedown strike power.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\",\"$\":\"1\"},{\"@name\":\"_DisplayPowers\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14171\"}],\"rules\":{\"grant\":{\"@name\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14171\",\"@type\":\"Power\"}},\"$\":\"Mercenaries learn to incorporate all sorts of pragmatic tactics into their fighting.

Many people are forced to do unfortunate things to survive; some are wrongly accused, and others find that the laws and structures that are meant to shield the weak from their depredations protect oppressors. Outlaw heroes are wanted by the authorities in their native realms. They risk arrest every time they show themselves, and they must develop a talent for disguise, take to a life in the wilderness, or master the art of the quick escape if they want to avoid the executioner's axe.\\nOutlaws might come to be outlaws for a variety of reasons. An insecure tyrant might decree the destruction of a noble family that poses a threat to his reign, leaving the survivors destitute and hunted by royal authorities. A tragic misunderstanding or accident might condemn an individual, who is discovered standing over a murdered archmage's body with a bloody dagger in her hand. No one believes her when she tries to explain that she found him already dead. In a realm where the powerful are free to oppress the weak, standing up to a cruel official or lord who injures or mistreats someone can easily turn a hero into an outlaw. However, it's far more common for an outlaw to justly stand condemned for her actions. She might be a habitual scofflaw who defies authority, or she might have made one tragic mistake in a moment of desperation or anger. Many paths can lead a person to earn a price on his or her head, and not all are undeserved.\\nOutlaw heroes often win the gratitude and loyalty of the poor people in the lands nearby, especially if they're standing up for commoners against oppressive rulers. In lands where the lawful authorities are weak or corrupt, outlaw heroes might be the only resource for defeating dangerous monsters and putting a stop to villainous plots. In addition, some officials and nobles deliberately cultivate contacts with capable outlaws. Sometimes it's useful to hire agents to do illegal things for good reasons . . . or for selfish ones. Ambitious nobles or courtiers often find employment for criminals and have ways to protect them from arrest or set them free again if they prove useful. Friends at court can make life much more comfortable for outlaw heroes.\\nCreating an Outlaw: Obviously, rogues are drawn to the outlaw's path; few rogues are ever in the law's good graces, even if they spend most of their time pilfering hoards in monster-haunted dungeons. Fighters and rangers are also well suited to the rigors of an outlaw's life, since they're tough and self-reliant. Clerics and wizards are less likely to be outlaws, but such a combination is not unheard of; a cleric who sees that the authorities are corrupt might be compelled by conscience to aid outlaws who resist injustice. Warlocks are often practitioners of arts frowned upon (or banned outright) by the powers that be, and they become accustomed to following their own paths regardless of the local laws.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Outlaw Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3909\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 399\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"You gain the surprise strike power.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\",\"$\":\"1\"},{\"@name\":\"_DisplayPowers\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14175\"}],\"rules\":{\"grant\":{\"@name\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14175\",\"@type\":\"Power\"}},\"$\":\"As an outlaw, you've learned that you can't afford the luxury of a fair fight.

When one warrior has a quarrel with one another, he or she confronts that person. A brawl in the road (or, rarely, a duel to the death) is a perfectly acceptable way to settle such conflicts. These warriors value their given word highly, and they hold liars and cheats in utter contempt.

Most mortals fear what they cannot explain, including death. Those innovative souls who dare to actively seek out death's secrets learn that an entirely new realm of shadow awaits their discovery. Many temples and libraries include tomes on the subject of death. If someone had enough motivation and spent plenty of time researching, he or she could soon learn of the famed shadow mage Evard.\\nEvard, an enigmatic and potent practitioner of shadow magic, is a master of necromancy and nethermancy. His legacy is such that anyone who has spent time researching the Shadowfell has undoubtedly come across his most famous work, Legendry of Phantoms and Ghosts. This 800-page omnibus is one of the finest pieces of writing on the subjects of shadow magic, necromancy, and nethermancy. It covers everything from the creation of apparitions to details on their metaphysical construction and anatomy.\\nThose who learn of Evard and begin to study his work could become enthralled by all things related to the Shadowfell. Some who study Evard's works become recluses; others might seek to adventure in an effort to learn more of the Shadowfell and its inhabitants. On a research level, those seeking knowledge on these topics try to understand the breaching of the two planes of existence and learn how both sides interact with each other. As Evard noted, \\\"You can never come to appreciate the fabric and essence of life without first knowing in full detail the beauty of death.\\\"\\t\\nCreating: Students of Evard are introverted, analytical individuals who study death and the afterlife. The succinct and deliberate way in which Evard's Legendry of Phantoms and Ghosts was written makes it seem more like a school textbook rather than something read for enjoyment. Students of Evard are inclined toward the scholarly classes, such as cleric, invoker, warlock, and wizard. Some martial classes study Evard's writings as well.

With all the political intrigue surrounding daily life within the city, many wealthy and powerful individuals ceaselessly work to expand their spheres of influence. One way in which they accomplish this is by sending out special envoys that work to further their interests and the interests of Gloomwrought. These Gloomwrought emissaries are crucial to the expansion of the city's political reach and are the eyes and ears of the noble houses.\\nJoining this elite corps of specialists can be difficult, and whom you know-not what you know-is important in most cases. In some cases, an existing agent of a house recruits emissaries passively by following them for some time and observing them from a distance so their skills and abilities can be gauged. This gives the recruiter time to evaluate and pass judgment before contacting the potential emissary and bringing him or her on board. In other cases, emissaries are cultivated from within the house and are trained from a young age, a method that has a high success rate in developing bright new talent.\\nYour life as a Gloomwrought emissary depends largely on the master you represent. You might serve as a crafty spy, or a hired assassin sent to eradicate an enemy of your house. You could serve Gloomwrought as a diplomat by using your silver tongue to help spur, or incite, bloody conflict. No matter how you choose to serve, you are an important part of the city's social landscape.\\nCreating: Most Gloomwrought emissaries are martial combatants: rangers, rogues, and sometimes fighters. These classes have the requisite skill and proficiency to engage opponents in close combat effectively. Because of their cunning and grit, many brutal scoundrel rogues are enlisted as information brokers. They can use their contacts to gain intelligence from others and pressure them into giving up information. Rangers are employed for their ability to traverse the dangerous landscape of the Shadowfell, seeking out other communities and conclaves. They are also adept at tracking those who might have fled the city, and they serve as respected bounty hunters.\\nFor those characters who accept life as a Gloomwrought emissary, training begins immediately, and the path to completion is as dangerous as it is rigorous. Senior members of a house's diplomatic corps set up various trials and tests that must be mastered before a recruit can progress. Despite what is said otherwise, death and dismemberment are a cruel reality of some training missions that emissaries must undertake.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Gloomwrought Emissary Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4065\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 400\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"You gain the Strike from the Shadows power.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\",\"$\":\"1\"},{\"@name\":\"_DisplayPowers\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14326\"}],\"rules\":{\"grant\":{\"@name\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14326\",\"@type\":\"Power\"}},\"$\":\"Gloomwrought is a dangerous city where one misstep can spell your demise.

You escaped with your life, but with no allies and no idea of what to do next.\\n\\tNone survive alone in the wilds of the Underdark for long, and so your would-be killers assumed you to be dead-as you would have been if the members of Bregan D'aerthe had not found you. You had heard the tales of these drow mercenaries, of course-the much-derided and dishonorable castaways of other destroyed houses. When your benefactors confirmed that your kin had been annihilated, you expected them to show contempt for the weakness of your house and your own helplessness. Instead, they offered to induct you into their company-giving you a chance to restore the honor, the allies, and the home that had been taken from you.\\n\\tFor decades, you have served as part of Bregan D'aerthe. As a part of the force sent to the surface to manipulate events in Luskan, you have watched that city's steady decline from den of piracy to cesspool of evil. You felt the tremors in the earth and saw the plume of black smoke to the south that marked Neverwinter's fall. During this time, Bregan D'aerthe continued to add to its coffers with missions for hire, but the opportunities for wealth grew slimmer as the danger in the North spread.\\n\\tNow, the mercenary drow have largely left the region, with only a few such as you remaining. You would have preferred to go with your fellows, but an order from Jarlaxle brought you instead to the ruins of Neverwinter.

You have been told that someone-perhaps Jarlaxle himself-will come to you for information. Until then, you are on your own.\\n\\tYou have learned that it doesn't pay to be without allies-even in the relative safety of the surface world. Few surface-dwellers have any compunctions about the death of a lone drow, particularly in the lawless North.

Luskan is controlled by a consortium of gangs, war chiefs, and would-be rulers, few of which last more than a season.\\n\\tThe Dead Rats are one of the exceptions.\\n\\tThat thieves' guild has earned the respect and fear of the populace through a campaign of intimidation. Its members are known for their stealth, their ruthlessness, and their treachery. It is rumored-correctly-that the most deadly members of the gang are wererats. Like the creatures from which they derive their power, the Dead Rats can penetrate any safe house, no matter how secure. Initiation into the gang involves a blood ritual with one of these wererats, imbuing members of the guild with a sneaky and twitchy demeanor, particularly on nights of the full moon.\\n\\tEvery member of the gang is fiercely loyal to a captain named Toytere-a halfling bard noted for his ability to see the future. Whether he truly possesses such sight or not, “King Toy” has never fallen to any of the attempts made to overthrow him. He has frequently rooted out would-be betrayers before they act, and he punishes anyone who attempts to leave the gang.

You made off with less than you expected, but like a good Rat, you gave over the one-quarter share due to King Toy and resolved to enjoy the rest. The next night, when you returned to your safe house, you were taken prisoner by wererat marauders and brought before King Toy. The halfling accused you of planning a mutiny and expected you to understand his need to purge his gang of disloyalty. His bodyguards drew their steel.\\n\\tMuch blood was shed that night, but you escaped-barely alive and thanking Tymora for your good fortune. You fled Luskan, nigh penniless and with only the tools of your trade to your name. Your destination was the nearest safe haven you could manage-the comparatively civilized city of Neverwinter, several days' journey to the south.\\n\\tExhausted, not knowing whom to trust, you thought at last that you had found somewhere to rest and ply your trade once more. Any good thief could spot the coin to be made or taken in this disorderly city. Perhaps your flight from Luskan was good fortune in disguise-you won't have the gang's dubious protection here, but you'll be free to keep all of your booty.

The last decades have grown progressively darker, presenting a great opportunity for cultists that promise protection from the terrors of the frontier-at the comparatively small cost of eternal loyalty and secrecy. Or so the stories and tales go.\\n\\tIn reality, most of the cults that operate in the North have no deific connections, but are composed of indolent noble scions using the threat of darkness to gain romantic favor or to intimidate business rivals into closing up shop and skipping town. In such cults, young nobles claim to supplicate devils for the sake of their own jests, then drink themselves into oblivion while waiting for their servants to clean up the mess.\\n\\tYou used to belong to one such false cult-or at least you thought you did.\\n\\tIt seemed like a good idea at the time-allying with powerful individuals in Waterdeep in the mutual pursuit of authority, pleasure, and coin. Now, however, you've made a terrible mistake-one that you might end up paying for with your eternal soul.\\n\\tAlthough you come from a noble bloodline, you've never been particularly wealthy or influential. In the cult, however, you could rub shoulders with powerful and wealthy noble heirs who are excited to delve into the dark. You saw the potential in making important connections to your fellow noble scions, in the hope of securing a good marriage when you finally decided to settle down.\\n\\tAt your infrequent rituals, celebrants would gather around braziers of white-hot coals and invoke the power of strangely named beings. Chanting would ensue, along with tedious and false religious mummery. Nothing ever came of these rites, of course, and each secret conclave would eventually devolve into the more important business of drinking, scheming, and hedonism. It all seemed harmless.\\n\\tThen one day, you were late for a meeting. When you arrived, it was to discover a ritual chamber covered in blood and gore. Your fellow cultists had been brutally dismembered as by a storm of ravaging claws and fangs. The central brazier burned with an unbelievably hot flame, drawing your attention. Enraptured, you stepped toward it, unable to resist. Fire flared, driving into your chest like a lance as it burned you, body and soul.\\n\\tWhen you awoke, it was in your own bed, far from the scene of the cult's massacre. You were happy to dismiss the memory as a nightmare-until you glimpsed a mark on your chest that made the nightmare real. You bear a crimson brand now-a sigil that you somehow recognize as the mark of Asmodeus. What it means, you have no idea-but the implications terrify you.\\n\\tTricked, confused, and scared out of your mind, you fled Waterdeep for a place where you might hope to hide from those who know you. In N everwinter, you have spent uncounted days looking over your shoulder and dreaming of treachery, violence, and fire.\\n\\tYou seek to gather allies to your side, fearful of what the power that binds you has in store.

In the group's glory days, its members included figures of legend such as Storm Silverhand, whose beautiful voice matched her ferocity in battle, and Arilyn Moonblade, a half-elf wielder of powerful and ancient elven magic. The Harpers passed from existence in the wake of the Spellplague, but the organization was reborn sixty years ago and is now based out of the city of Everlund, several hundred miles northeast of Neverwinter. Its stated purpose is to stop the encroachment of the expanding empire of Netheril.\\n\\tYou grew up hearing tales of the Harpers' exploits and have long sought to do your part to stem the tide of darkness. You've always had a facility for deception and intrigue, coupled with a strong sense of right and wrong. As you grew older, you searched for the best way to put those skills to good use. You journeyed to Everlund to enlist in the group, whereupon you were given a task to complete in order to earn your Harper pin.\\n\\tYou were dispatched to Neverwinter, there to contact a local Harper agent named Cymril and lend your services to the Sons of Alagondar. Cymril, in addition to being one of the few Harpers in the city, is the leader of the Sons of Alagondar. This underground resistance movement opposes the imperialistic aims of Dagult Neverember, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, who has established himself as the “Protector” of Neverwinter during its reconstruction. The Harpers believe that Neverember's intentions are less than noble, and that he seeks to expand his mercantile empire for his own gain at the expense of the people. They are sure that, with his ruthless methods and suspect alliances, Neverember plans to usurp the throne of Neverwinter and build a cutthroat empire on the Sword Coast.\\n\\tOn your arrival, you learned the hard way that Neverember's treachery runs deeper than even the Harpers know. You were included among a band of rebels on a nighttime reconnaissance mission led by Cymril. All of a sudden, your world turned inside out when a squad of Neverember's mercenaries ambushed your group. You avoided the initial assault by ducking into an alcove-where you watched as Cymril began cutting down your comrades! Clearly, she was working in league with the soldiers. One of Cymril's lieutenants turned on her and wounded her fatally just before he himself was cut down by the mercenaries.\\n\\tWhen the mercenaries moved on, they left the bodies of their victims (including Cymril) in the street as a warning to other dissidents. Before you left the area, you had the foresight to pluck Cymril's Harper pin from her vest, lest it fall into the wrong hands.\\n\\tWas Cymril truly a traitor to Neverwinter's cause, or was she working as a double agent? You can't be sure. What you do know is that when both the Sons of Alagondar and the Harpers got wind of what had happened, they immediately suspected that someone in the ambushed group was working for the other side.\\n\\tAs the newcomer, you bear the brunt of the suspicion of both groups. The city's rebel forces have fractured since Cymril's death into disorganized and ineffective war bands. Discovering which of the few Harper associates in Neverwinter you can trust is important to you. However, if you have to work alone to get the job done, that's what you'll do. Your main goal is to ascertain the truth about Cymril, and in the process of doing that, you seek any means you can to thwart Neverember's true plans for the city.\\n\\tAs a rogue agent, you work without official Harper support, and are free to use your own methods and make your own decisions regarding whom to trust. Each new day is an exciting and dangerous game of masks-guessing who speaks the truth, who offers you lies in the hope of securing an advantage, and who is the true enemy in any given situation.

Said to be the pinnacle of dwarven culture, Delzoun was a place whose citizens were happy and productive, trading in relative peace with their neighbors. When Netheril was laid low by the folly of the mage Karsus, it was not only the Shadovar that suffered.\\n\\tLike so many of the dwarves of the North, your family claims direct descent from Delzoun. However, with so many making that same claim, who knows if any speak the truth? In private, for much of your life, you've had your doubts.\\n\\tThen seventeen years ago, during the Summons, the ghosts came.\\n\\tPerhaps only one in a thousand dwarves has made a believable claim to have seen them-but you are one of those chosen few. Clad in the vestments of ancient times, the ghosts spoke with a voice that only you could hear. Pleading in the manner of dwarves in the most desperate need, they begged for help-not for themselves, but for all your kind. They spoke of an “awakening beast” that must not be allowed to rise. And before they vanished, they begged you to come to them-in Gauntlgrym.\\n\\tGauntlgrym. What dwarf of the North has not dreamed of that place? Most people think it a myth or a ruin cast to rubble ages ago, but dwarves know different. Dwarves feel the truth in their bones.\\n\\tFor a time, Gauntlgrym was the capital of Delzoun. The underground city was the grandest settlement in the North-perhaps in all the world. Doors cast of pure mithral opened at a dwarf 's slightest touch. A forge burned there so mighty that items of enchantment could be made without magic. So great was Gauntlgrym that humans, elves, halflings, and gnomes all begged to live beneath its roof, and were welcome.\\n\\tYet Gauntlgrym fell long ago-first to orcs, then to humans who claimed it, then to mind flayers, and finally to the mists of history. Rumors have placed it in numerous locations. Some claim to have seen it or have maps to it, but lunatics and scoundrels assert many things. The Summons drew many to search for it, including you.\\n\\tIn the end, your search has brought you to the Neverwinter region, where Gauntlgrym might yet lie hidden. Some of your family think you mad. Others burn like the sun with pride, for you have the opportunity to prove their claim of Delzoun blood. Many have sought Gauntlgrym before; others do so now, because you are not the only dwarf to have seen the phantoms or to claim the blood of ages. But if you can succeed, you can elevate yourself and your family name to the heights of dwarven annals and legends. You can restore the remnants of your people's greatest glory. And, just possibly, you can prevent the rise of an evil as great as that which destroyed Delzoun.\\n\\tThe dire warnings of the ghosts whose summons you obey weigh heavily on your heart. You have followed the rumors that bore the greatest ring of truth, but now that you've reached Neverwinter, you know that completing your quest will require all the help you can get.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Heir of Delzoun Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3934\",\"@source\":\"Neverwinter Campaign Guide\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"As a sign that you do indeed possess the pure blood of your ancestors, one of the hallmark traits of your people is stronger in you.\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"Gain resistance to poison equal to 5 + one-half your level\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\",\"$\":\"1\"}],\"rules\":{\"statadd\":[{\"@name\":\"Heir of Delzoun Starting Feature\",\"@value\":\"+HALF-LEVEL\"},{\"@name\":\"Heir of Delzoun Starting Feature\",\"@value\":\"+5\"},{\"@name\":\"resist:poison\",\"@value\":\"+Heir of Delzoun Starting Feature\",\"@type\":\"resist\"}]},\"$\":\"You gain resistance to poison equal to 5 + one-half your level.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 5 Heir of Delzoun Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3935\",\"@source\":\"Neverwinter Campaign Guide\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"5\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"Your adventurous life in pursuit of Gauntlgrym has made you more hardy than most.\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"Gain a healing surge\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\",\"$\":\"5\"}],\"rules\":{\"statadd\":{\"@name\":\"Healing Surges\",\"@value\":\"+1\"}},\"$\":\"You gain a healing surge.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 10 Heir of Delzoun Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3936\",\"@source\":\"Neverwinter Campaign Guide\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"10\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"Your connection to Delzoun's storied past clings to you like a mantle.

Like the empire that spawned it, Iliyanbruen also fell in time. Many of its folk left for Evermeet, even as others retreated into the Feywild. With powerful magic, the elves of old transported most of Sharandar, the capital city of Iliyanbruen, to the Feywild. Their plan was for Iliyanbruen to rise once more on the site of the original home of the elven people-but events seldom align with the intentions of those who live them.\\n\\tAlthough Iliyanbruen rose once more, the Feywild was no empty frontier. The forces that drove the ancient elves to first leave Faerie for the world still held sway in many places. Enemies of these returned folk-particularly the Winter Court and the Twilight Fey-arrayed against them. Treants, dryads, centaurs, firbolgs, satyrs, and other creatures that might once have been allies saw the Iliyanbruen eladrin only as invaders.\\n\\tGenerations of battles and legends later, Iliyanbruen endures as a realm, its borders several days' walk from the ruins of Sharandar. That land has always been your home, and your people have lived there in relative peace for generations.\\n\\tWith the coming of the Spellplague, everything changed. Faerie and the world were brought into conjunction once more. Some eladrin grew eager to determine what had become of their worldly home. This was easier said than done, however, for a covey of hags and their dark servants had taken over Sharandar, making travel difficult at best. Although you initially had little real interest in old Iliyanbruen beyond mild historical curiosity, you were quick to join the effort at ousting the evil fey from the region.\\n\\tSeveral of your friends were injured or slain before your people reclaimed the territory and established an outpost in the ruins. From there, you and your fellows ventured back into the mortal world where the eladrin of Iliyanbruen had not stepped for centuries.\\n\\tYou were horrified at what you found. Though you had expected the kingdom's ancient tree-cities to have fallen into disrepair, you found many of them looted as well. Their structures were ravaged and desecrated, with ancient treasures of statuary, artwork, and holy icons all stolen away.\\n\\tFierce debate arose among the fey of New Sharandar. Some, enraged by what had occurred, demanded that the eladrin reenter the mortal world in force, wreaking vengeance on any who lingered near the ruins of Iliyanbruen-or even the entirety of what was once Illefarn. Others of calmer mien said that the eladrin should reclaim the greatest ruins of Iliyanbruen, restore them to the glory of old, and take vengeance only on those directly responsible for their debasement. However, for that effort to work, the eladrin must learn who has despoiled their ancient home.\\n\\tYou are determined to find out who has ravaged the ruins, which are already weakened by time. In discovering who stole your ancestral treasures-and what creatures deserve your wrath-you intend that justice be meted out appropriately. You are driven not only by anger and vengeance, but also by a sense of urgency. For you know that if you fail, the wrathful among your people will gain the upper hand, spilling the blood of the guilty and the innocent alike.\\n\\tMany eladrin have made the natural world their home as they seek answers-and you are one of them. Some set out in search of allies, hoping that fabled Evermeet or one of the elven kingdoms of old still exists. Others have set their sights on the areas closer to Neverwinter Wood, feeling certain that those responsible for the desecration of your birthright have not gone far.\\n\\tIt appears that you were right. Even as you began your investigation of the ruins of Neverwinter, you arrived late for a rendezvous with your fellows to find them slain by powerful magic. Whoever the wrongdoers might be, they outnumber you. You know you need allies in the fight against them, but if news of the slaughter spreads among your people in the Feywild, it could mean war.

Since then, the angry earth has calmed, inviting people to return to the ruins of this once-great settlement. Dagult Neverember-the imperialist Open Lord of Waterdeep-has declared himself a distant relation of the old rulers of Neverwinter, and thus claims to be the rightful heir to their holdings. He has installed himself as Neverwinter's Lord Protector until the city is rebuilt and order is fully restored-at which point he is expected to name himself king. Given Neverember's control of Waterdeepand the military and magical power that control grants him, few have expressed any desire to dispute his claim-at least not until a true heir is found.\\n\\tA true heir such as you.\\n\\tYou are a last scion of Neverwinter's former ruling family. Your mother was a noble who fled the city during the cataclysm, wounded during her escape and driven to madness by pain and grief. When she perished shortly after you were born, a noble family of Waterdeep-the Thanns-took you in and raised you as their own.\\n\\tYou grew up with heroic stories, poetry, and the best education a young noble could have. With Neverwinter in ruins and your kin all dead, your adoptive parents thought it best to hide from you their knowledge of your tragic past. However, in the aftermath of Lord Neverember's seizing power in Neverwinter, you have finally been told the truth.\\n\\tAt first, you weren't certain what to do. In one moment, it felt as though you had lost two families-the old and the new. You had never seen Neverwinter, but what you had heard of the city didn't make it seem like a place worth claiming. If you ignored your birthright, you could continue to live a life of relative ease and luxury in Waterdeep.\\n\\tEventually, you came to see your problem a different way. Though your new family will always be there for you, whatever remains of your connection to Neverwinter is in imminent danger of being swept away. You have the opportunity to know your lost past-even if only through the relics of that past. And by claiming what belongs to you, you'll exchange a life of idle nobility for one of responsible royalty.\\n\\tYet you are not naive enough to believe that the path forward will be easy. Reclaiming the city is not as simple as declaring your identity. Neverember commands an army of warriors and mages, and his influence ties him to hundreds of powerful individuals around the Sword Coast with their own reasons to crush an upstart like a flea.\\n\\tYou need proof of your ancestry-something in the ruins of the city that can verify the story that was told to you. If you're lucky, you might find a symbol of your royal past such as a crown or a scepter to lend credence to your claim. Then you will have to prove yourself a champion-to win the hearts and minds of the people as you convince them that it is you, not Neverember, who deserves to rule a reclaimed and rebuilt Neverwinter. Only then might you restore the city to its past glory and do honor to your blood heritage.\\n\\tYou recognize the need to gather allies, both to defend the city against its many foes and to protect yourself against those who want to prevent you from reclaiming your birthright.

Not all members of the Gray Wolf tribe manifest the beast within in the same way, but you all share it to one extent or another, feeling it bind you in ways few other people can comprehend. You are warriors among your humanoid kin, predators among the beasts of the woodland. You move as one, you live as one, you hunt as one.\\n\\tOr rather, you did.\\n\\tFor uncounted generations, your people have venerated the five spiritual pillars on which Gray Wolf culture is based-tradition, the primal spirits, your god Uthgar, the spirits of your ancestors, and the natural order. It never crossed your mind what might happen if the tribe violated any of those precepts, because such a thing was unthinkable. But in the end, the unthinkable happened.\\n\\tIn retrospect, you could see the first hints long before things went truly wrong. The current Gray Wolf leaders are more vicious, more bloodthirsty, than those who came before. The Gray Wolf Uthgardt has always been a violent tribe-you carry the fury of the werewolf, after all. However, where you once killed only for sustenance or in defense of your tribal territories, your folk have become raiders as much as hunters.\\n\\tGray Wolf hunters began to kill for material gain-even, on dark occasion, for sport. Then that darkness was deepened when the shadowed ones came, claiming to represent ancient Netheril reborn. Through honeyed words and the invocation of ancient and long-forgotten alliances, they enticed your leaders into an insidious pact.\\n\\tThe history of your tribe has been passed down through generations as stories told by the fireside, and the tales the Netherese told matched those stories. The Uthgardt did come from the blood of old Netheril. The lycanthropy that makes the Gray Wolf tribe strong originated in descendants of Netheril, when refugees from fallen Gauntlgrym carried the curse into the tribe.\\n\\tYet these facts alone would not have been enough to form an alliance had not the pack's leaders hungered for the glory of which the shadowed ones spoke. They said that just as old blood ties could be remembered, so too could the glory of the Uthgardt be revived. Conquest would achieve that glory, and when the Netherese controlled the North, the Gray Wolf tribe would be the masters of everything else.\\n\\tNow, your kin fight, kill, and die in the name of motives and goals not their own. However, though doing so went against everything you'd ever been taught, you are among the few who have refused to take up the darkness of this new path. Your instincts told you it was right to do so, even as the Gray Wolf leaders cast you out. Your tribe called you weak and unworthy, yet you left with your head held high.\\n\\tIndeed, from what you have heard, it's a good thing you made your stand when you did. Had you waited, your punishment might have been more final than exile. Whispered messages, passed to you by those who feel as you do, suggest that the tribe's leaders are now willing to slaughter their own-not in proper challenge, but in cold-blooded murder.\\n\\tYou have a new purpose now. You must drive the shadows of Netheril from the North, finding a way to purge your tribe of the unsavory influences of that land. Only when you set the tribe on the right path will you win back your place in it.\\n\\tYou remain a creature of the pack, however, and you know you cannot realize your purpose alone. You must find new allies-a temporary pack to replace the one you have lost.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Pack Outcast Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3931\",\"@source\":\"Neverwinter Campaign Guide\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"Like all members of the Gray Wolves, you are and have always been a shapeshifter.\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"Gain the body of the wolf power\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\",\"$\":\"1\"},{\"@name\":\"Powers\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14205\"},{\"@name\":\"Type\",\"$\":\"Utility\"},{\"@name\":\"Class\"},{\"@name\":\"_DisplayPowers\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14205\"}],\"rules\":{\"grant\":{\"@name\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_14205\",\"@type\":\"Power\"}},\"$\":\"You gain the body of the wolf power.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 5 Pack Outcast Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3932\",\"@source\":\"Neverwinter Campaign Guide\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"5\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"You grew up hunting and fighting alongside others and have mastered pack-oriented tactics.

The regent Szass Tam and his Council of Zulkirs-liches all-rule this warring, slaving nation with fists of bone and iron. Those who have grown up under this regime find life in Thay entirely normal-fearsome, perhaps, but not at all unnatural. Those who have the proper magical skills and mindset can even carve out their own place within the necromantic order.\\n\\tYou were such a wizard-destined for greatness because of your magical potential. To your family's great honor, you joined the prestigious academies used to train mages for the ever-growing ranks of the Red Wizards of Thay. There, you were taught the fundamentals of magic in all its schools and forms, but your focus was necromancy.\\n\\tAt the time, this dedication seemed normal to you. Manipulating the forces of death itself? Animating those who had been living, breathing, laughing people into mindless, shambling slaves? This is the order of things in Thay-and will be the order across the rest of Faerûn if the regent has his way.\\n\\tSo might your life have gone, had not your best friend-a partner and companion throughout your years of schooling-failed an assigned experiment. It was nothing disastrous, only a ritual that went ever so slightly awry, but the event sent your instructor into a rage. When that rage was spent, your friend was dead, his life force sundered by necrotic energy.\\n\\tHe was also your next project, for his was the body that the class-working together to perform magic none of you could handle alone-was ordered to reanimate. And you complied, for fear of what might happen if you did not.\\n\\tFor the first time, the grotesque, decaying face before you was not that of a stranger. For the first time, you knew of and could feel the utter absence of the life and laughter that once had thrived behind those eyes.\\n\\tYou finally understood the horror of what you had been trained to do, and in that moment you forswore necromancy-and Thay itself.\\n\\tIt wasn't that hard to flee, for who would ever try to escape the academies-one of the only ways to gain real power in Szass Tam's Thay? By the time they knew to look for you, you were already gone.\\n\\tYou can barely remember the exhausting, starving months of travel, constantly watching over your shoulder. When you came to the Sword Coast, you realized you had literally fled as far as you could go. Only then did it occur to you to stop running and try to determine what the future might hold.\\n\\tIn time, you wandered north to Neverwinter, a place where most of the population was struggling to build new lives. A place where you thought you might fit in. However, it didn't take you long to hear whispered rumors of a darkness in the North-rumors that dashed all hope of leaving your past behind.\\n\\tThe Thayans are here, conducting their foul experiments and stealing people away in the night. How many Neverwintans have joined the ranks of Thay's slaves after death? How often are more living, laughing faces taking on the foul grin of the undead?\\n\\tIt never crossed your mind to run again. You don't know what the Thayans are doing in the North, but you know that their efforts here can be stopped. They can be defeated.

This last bastion of ancient Netheril had survived for over a millennium in the depths of the Shadowfell, where the raw essence of shadow has long intertwined with the souls of the Shadovar. Some have become shades; some are born shadar-kai. Most are still human, but with an element of darkness about them.\\n\\tYou were born into the nobility of the Shadovar-not at any great rank, but high enough to ensure yourself a position of power in the restored empire. Like all Shadovar, you were raised to believe in Netherese supremacy-bombarded constantly with the knowledge that dominance was your people's birthright, that the other peoples of Toril were weak and inferior, and that Netheril would rule once more.\\n\\tYou had no reason not to believe in your great destiny. At least, not at first. However, as your education progressed, you were sent out into the world to observe Netherese military actions. Serving the overseers of “reclaimed” communities, you would occasionally skirmish with the border patrols of neighboring nations. For reasons you still do not fully understand, something in the world beyond Shade Enclave spoke to you as your home never had.\\n\\tYou stood in the light of the sun, untouched by the lingering darkness of the Shadowfell, and felt its burn not as painful but as cleansing. You observed the “weak and worthless” folk beyond Netheril and perceived a simple joy for life that you could never imagine seeing within the Shadovar. You knew instantly that this was the life you wanted-one far from the machinations, tyranny, and darkness of your home.\\n\\tYou had to pull some strings and con your family into pulling others. However, in the end, it wasn't hard to have yourself assigned to the ongoing Netherese efforts in Neverwinter Wood, hunting for old ruins and ancient magic. Your hope was that this Shadovar endeavor farthest from Netheril would provide you the opportunity to disappear before you were missed.\\n\\tIt worked, in part. You were able to slip away between expeditions into the woods and make your way to Neverwinter. So far, you've managed to keep your past a secret, seeming to be just one of the many people trying to make a fresh start in a slowly recovering city.\\n\\tYet something eats at you as you try to start your new life. Your people have not come to the North just to dig up the detritus of old empires. The magic they find here is meant to be put to a purpose. You don't know what that purpose might be, but before you left Netheril, you heard whispered rumors that spoke of raising an enclave.\\n\\tIt's a crazy idea. The magic to perform such a mighty ritual hasn't existed since the fall of Netheril over a thousand years ago. Certainly, other enclaves have been launched into the air since the Year of Wild Magic, but these were existing structures. The powerful magic of the mythallars that allows such structures to take to the skies was already extant, only needing repair. Surely nothing like that could be found anywhere near Neverwinter . . . or could it?\\n\\tYou came to Neverwinter to flee, but more and more, you wonder if you could ever have run far enough. If you remain here, you know you won't be able to hide forever. If the Netherese succeed in their plans for the region, a new Shadovar stronghold might arise here-one possibly as mighty as Shade Enclave. If that happens, you would find yourself in the shadow of Netheril once again. Much as you'd like to simply vanish into the darkness, the dark is where your people are most dangerous.

Few of those alive today can describe this scourge firsthand, and every story disagrees in the details. Landscapes changed, whole cities vanished, and alien nations installed themselves where barren wasteland and the ruins of past civilizations had stood for millennia. Magic failed or went wild, and thousands upon thousands died horribly. Those who encountered the plague directly, either initially or in the long years since, have been forever changed by its touch. Most are horribly deformed or otherwise cursed-even as a rare few gain a strange kind of power.\\n\\tSomeone seeing you as a youth might not have known you were bound to such a twisted destiny. You were a normal person, living out a normal life. You had family and friends, and you were looking forward to marriage and children to carry on your legacy. These simple pleasures were not to be yours, however-not once the nightmares began. You ignored the visions at first, but you could not do so for long.\\n\\tOne night, you awoke from a nightmare screaming, engulfed in blue flames that were no dream. Though it did not harm you, this unnatural fire wreaked havoc on everything nearby, consuming your home and those you loved, their screams echoing as they burned. When the flames died away, they left in their wake disfigurements on the bodies of the dead-warped limbs, blue scar tissue, or strange runes in a language you did not recognize. Though you survived the destruction, your body was likewise scarred.\\n\\tHated for the harm you inflicted unintentionally and despised for your deformity, you fled your home in fear. Dependent on the aid of strangers to survive, you were saved when a wandering priest sworn to Ilmater, god of compassion, directed you to Helm's Hold outside the city of Neverwinter. There, he promised, people like you were welcome. “The spellscarred,” he called you.\\n\\tDuring your journey, you have tried to puzzle out the reason for the emergence of your curse, to no certain success. Perhaps you were exposed to the Spellplague long ago, and it then lay dormant in you for years. Some say the curse can be inherited by blood, and so the affliction will lead inevitably to more death-for you and those around you.\\n\\tYou fear that your time grows short. Whenever you rest, the nightmares that haunted you before your scarring return, coupled with visions of magical cataclysms wreathed in blue flame. You have grown accustomed to looking over your shoulder at all times, struggling to trust even those who seek to aid you.\\n\\tA time is coming when you'll be able to conceal your true nature no longer.

You are part of the Thunderbeast tribe, and even as you pay homage to Uthgar and the spirits of your ancestors, you keep the sacred secret of those great reptilian creatures where they hide in the shadowed heart of the High Forest.\\n\\tRecently, your tribe left its High Forest home to travel far west to Neverwinter Wood. As is tradition for all Uthgardt, autumn is the time of Runemeet-a holy period when each tribe travels to its ancestor mound to worship the ancient spirits. Your tribe's mound is Morgur's Mound, considered to be the holiest site of your people. There, Uthgar shed his blood in battle against Gurt, Lord of the Pale Giants, and broke the back of Gurt's armies to save the North from domination. Within that same mound are buried the remains of Uthgar's mortal brother, the hero Morgur.\\n\\tAt Runemeet, youths in an Uthgardt tribe who want to become fully recognized members must engage in a ritual hunt of sworn enemies of their tribe-wolves, in the case of the Thunderbeast barbarians. This was to be your hunt year, and you looked forward to the ceremonies and celebrations at the most holy of the ancestor mounds with great anticipation. However, the ceremony was not to be.\\n\\tYour tribe found Morgur's Mound desecrated. The skeleton of the thunderbeast that had rested atop it for untold generations had been stolen, and the mound broken open like a gutted animal. The holy bones of Uthgar's brother and the treasures they had been buried with were taken as well.\\n\\tThe immensity of the tragedy and the affront to your tribe-indeed, to all Uthgardt-drove your people mad for a time. Once rage cooled to grief, your chieftain Grandthur announced that the tribe would return to the High Forest. Whoever had defiled your ancestor mound had covered their tracks well, and it would take time to discover the culprits. To spend this time so close to the open wound in their hearts would weaken your people, for without an ancestor mound, they could not perform the traditions that would keep them strong.\\n\\tGrandthur declared that the tribe would travel to Flint Rock, the ancestor mound of the Elk Tribe, to join their fellow Uthgardt there. Then the chieftain turned to you.\\n\\tAlthough you were not yet ceremonially recognized, you had proven yourself an able hunter and a combatant who could rival the veterans of the tribe in skill and tenacity. To replace the ritual hunt that you had been meant to undertake, Grandthur gave you the task of discovering the defilers. It would be your duty to await the return of the Gray Wolf tribe-the Uthgardt who traditionally roam near Neverwinter Wood but who were currently away to the north at their own ancestor mound, Raven Rock. You will ask them what they know of the ruin brought upon your people and request their help in restoring Morgur's Mound to its sacred purpose.

Their charismatic leader, Cymril, was slain less than a month ago, plunging the organization into chaos. Factions have emerged, each of them forging alliances with dark forces in the city.

You were raised on legends, tales, and songs of the kingdom of Ardeep and the great elven empire of Illefarn before it.\\n\\tIn ancient days, elves ruled a great empire in the North called Illefarn. This empire fractured when the last Coronal of the elves led the retreat to Evermeet. Illefarn split into the nations of Ardeep, Iliyanbruen, and Rilitha. These kingdoms each fell in turn over the centuries, with the last of the elves leaving Ardeep for Evermeet over a century ago.\\n\\tYour parents and others moved into the Ardeep Forest to try to reclaim and relive something of Ardeep's former glory. But little remains of  that lost civilization. As the seasons passed into years, you dreamed of glorious days when your people ruled the region in peace and fairness. You imagined ancient Aelinthaldaar, the capital of Illefarn, rising tall where Waterdeep stands now. You mourned the loss of that nation as though it happened recently, not gone from the world for over two thousand years. Illefarn fell not to the hostile orcs and other enemies that sought to destroy it, but to humans and dwarves and allied races whose growing presence squeezed the elves until the Coronal felt there was no room left for the culture that had thrived in the region since before the Crown Wars.\\n\\tIn your youth, you returned time and again to a glade dedicated to Corellon-not to pray, but to gaze in awe upon relics of lost Illefarn, including a single, cracked arrow said to have been launched from the bow of the empire's last Coronal, Syglaeth Audark.\\n\\tBut these were mere daydreams and empty wishes, and not part of your daily life until a few months ago, when several of your town's hunters returned with the body of an eladrin found dead near the Crypts of the Deepening Moon. Your people know well enough to avoid those tombs of Ardeep because of the creatures that guard them. Yet the fallen eladrin did not appear to be a typical tomb robber: the quality of her clothes and possessions indicated someone of higher rank, akin to a diplomat. But the style of her possessions more resembled the old fashions you'd seen on the statues and carvings of the ruins of Illefarn.\\n\\tThe town assembled a party of hunters and warriors to follow the eladrin's trail and learn where she came from, and you, having recently proven your skills in such matters, went along. Tracking the eladrin was hard but not impossible, with the trail eventually leading to Waterdeep. However, finding anyone who remembered the eladrin in such an enormous place proved more difficult than tracking her week-old trail through the forest, and many of your fellows abandoned the quest. But you pushed on. Something about the mystery drove you.\\n\\tYou finally met a group of moon elves that had seen the eladrin. They said she was secretive and spoke with a strange accent. She said she sought Ardeep, and the elves had assumed she meant Ardeep Forest. Apparently she had come from Neverwinter by ship. Why had she traveled to Ardeep Forest all the way from Neverwinter? Why the strange accent and clothes? Where did she come from-out of the distant past? It could be that the Neverwinter Woods, once the bastion of Iliyanbruen and a part of ancient Illefarn, holds the answers.\\n\\tPerhaps it was fate, or an omen from the gods, that this should happen now, when you are old enough to choose your own way and skilled enough to make a difference. In the mysterious depths of the Neverwinter Woods and its surroundings, you can seek out other lost remnants of ancient Illefarn. You must locate them, and reclaim their wonders, their knowledge, and their treasures for the elves, to whom they rightfully belong. You must safeguard your heritage from those who would desecrate it for personal gain.

Those who do so learn to accept both the best and the worst that the world can offer. Fatedancers understand that what should not happen, cannot happen; the proper way to live is to embrace what must be. By accepting what fate offers, they gain more than peace of mind-everything they do aligns with the true purpose of the world.\\n\\tTo know fate is to dance, for life compels one to quickly move from here to there, from one thought or place or event to another. Though outsiders believe fatedancers to be mercurial at best, random chance does not exist for those who embrace fate, only opportunities taken or missed. The future and the present are always exactly as they should be for fatedancers; such individuals exist in the moment. They get into a lot of trouble because of this stance, but they are usually lucky enough to get out of it. Theirs is the life of a vagabond, taking both good and bad fortune as it comes.\\n\\tAny adventurer who believes in luck as a force can be a fatedancer. Martial characters most often choose this theme. They do not depend on any external source for their powers, so they are attracted to a path that depends on their own actions. To their minds, reliance on arcane magic or the power of the gods is an attempt to circumvent what should happen.\\n\\tBards and rogues also have worldviews that encourage this way of life. Bards weave songs that tell of heroes' fortunes and misfortunes and thus naturally respect the power of fate. A few follow this tendency further and learn to rely on it, even though they also use arcane magic. Rogues approach their lives with equal parts daring, skill, and luck, but many take to heart the idea that it is better to be lucky than skilled.\\nCreating: A fatedancer's relationship with Fortune Cards is different from that of other characters.  By choosing this theme, your character has a greater choice of cards to play, as well as abilities that augment and encourage their use.  Other characters' Fortune Card decks vary thematically, but a fatedancer can build a deck with a wide variety of cards.

However, those seeking a quicker path to enlightenment or total devotion to the gods prefer remote monasteries or temples. Such places of worship offer immersion in spiritual pursuits and isolation from the distractions of civilization. Most are hidden high in remote hills or mountains, making the very act of finding the place a show of one's dedication to the sacred.\\n\\tAn urban shrine's clergy can look to the local authorities for protection from monsters, bandits, and enemies of the faith. A wilderness temple's devotees cannot-most secluded places of worship are as much fortress as monastery. Just as such a holy place needs walls, it also needs guardians who share the spiritual values of their less militant fellows.\\n\\tA sohei, sometimes called a yamabushi (“mountain warrior”) due to the usual site of farflung monasteries and shrines, is a monastic soldier trained as a temple guardian. Rather than focusing on intense religious instruction, a sohei receives training in meditation, body control, and martial techniques. Although devoted clergy of the same religion or sect might practice pacifism, a sohei warrior-monk does not.\\n\\tThe difference between a sohei and a fellow priest is type of duty. The warrior-monk looks out for the safety of the temple, allowing other priests to fulfill duties that are more spiritual. A sohei can also serve as the face of a religious order, going out into the world to spread the faith, strike against the temple's enemies, and seek objects and people important to the religion.\\n\\tA sohei's superiors are figures higher in his or her religious hierarchy. Every sohei is a devoted combatant with mastery over preferred weapons, and each serves those higher in the hierarchy with obedience. As part of their service to the religion, they also learn to wield magical power. Often divine in nature, this power is a blessing of the sohei's commitment to a deity. However, legendary sohei-even those from the same religious sect-wield varying mystical capabilities.\\n\\tA sohei can come from any walk of life. Children given into the service of a temple, whether orphans or nobles, can become sohei. Older initiates might be anything from outlaws to ronin. Requirements for becoming a militant priest include strength and willpower, as well as an abundance of energy and ambition that compels the individual to abandon the wholly meditative life.\\n\\tAn adventuring sohei frequently takes on a quest for his or her religious order. A few sohei go into the world to experience its mysteries, using worldly knowledge as part of a path to enlightenment. Other sohei, such as ronin, have been expelled from or have lost their temples. These wanderers search for a new purpose as much as any ronin does.\\nCreating: Sohei are religious devotees focused on martial practice. Although they might have different religions, purposes, and techniques, divine power unites them. Most of these warrior-monks come from among weapon-using divine classes, such as the avenger, cleric, paladin, and runepriest. Some sohei focus more on the martial aspect of training than on the supernatural, as fighters, rangers, and warlords do. Obscure religious orders that are devoted to primal or ancestral spirits could train barbarians, druids, seekers, and wardens to become sohei. Other cults might focus on the power of the mind over the body. Psionic practitioners such as ardents, battleminds, and monks could be sohei among these sects. Religious devotion can also involve arcane practice or shadow magic-a pious assassin, blackguard, hexblade, or swordmage might become a sohei.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Sohei Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4215\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 404\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"A key tenet of your early training is the importance of pressing your initial attack.

Despite the area's turbulent past, the advent of the Spellplague, and the rise of the Tuigan nation of Yaïmunnahar, the folk of the Hordelands live as they have for centuries. Because the steppe offers few resources, all the nomads of the Hordelands-Taan, as they call themselves-are master riders and hardy survivalists. They rely on their mounts and livestock, as well as connections to nature and primal power, for survival.\\n\\tPeople of the Hordelands venerate Teylas, the Sky Lord, who is called Akadi in Faerûn, and worship Etugen, Earth Mother, known among Faerûnians as Grumbar. Additionally, and to a lesser degree, the nomads idolize a plethora of other primal spirits. Some of these latter entities live in named places, such as oases, across the plains. Others represent important or fierce animals of the prairie.\\n\\tTribal customs among the nomads focus on pleasing the spirits as they seek to ensure that the elements remain in balance. Those living in the Hordelands believe that bad luck, such as an inability to find water, is the work of offended spirits. To aid them in their work with the spirits, the nomads use primal magic, and their familiarity with it grants them a sixth sense when it comes to spiritual influences. Not only do they gain closeness to the spirits that surround them, they can sense the presence of myriad fey crossings on the plains, which provides them with the opportunity to interact with fey creatures, too.\\nCreating: Nomads of the Hordelands are predominantly human, although a few have nonhuman blood. Every adult nomad is a warrior, though with varying skills, and all nomads respect primal spirits rather than deities. Martial practitioners and primal spellcasters are most widespread; only a few tribesfolk practice arcane arts. Fighters, rangers, and warlords are common, as are barbarians, druids, seekers, shamans, and wardens. Warlocks, especially those of the fey or vestige pact, and sorcerers are the usual wielders of arcane power among the nomads.

Sworn in service to the powerful nobles who govern the empire, they are expected to live and die according to their master's command. Cultured and refined, samurai dedicate themselves utterly to the tenets of bushido-the warrior's code that teaches that one's life is not one's own, and that nothing is more important than honor, obedience, and courage.\\n\\tSamurai are born into their class, enjoying social privileges second only to the ruling nobility. Many come from families that own land themselves, and thus grow up accustomed to a life of wealth and entitlement. The samurai's lofty place in society sometimes leads individuals down a path of arrogance or brutality, since a samurai is above the law when dealing with those of lower station; however, true followers of bushido emphasize traits such as benevolence and politeness, as well as courage.\\n\\tA samurai's training begins at a young age, when he is introduced to the rigorous demands of bushido. Young samurai are exposed to extreme heat, cold, and pain, enduring all with emotionless poise. They are steeled against the fear of death by being sent on errands through graveyards or near hangman's gallows at night. Each samurai-in-training is taught to read and write, contemplating classics of literature, religion, and art with which to refine his mind and spirit. Finally, all are taught the martial arts for which these warriors are most well known.\\n\\tSamurai heroes are expected to fight and die at their lord's command, and their adventures reflect that. Samurai will undertake any quest their master assigns them, whether waging open war or avenging an insult to their lord's honor; a samurai obeys without hesitation. A samurai who proves worthy of reward will be honored with lands and wealth, and, perhaps most important, the lord's approval. This honor, and the perpetual striving toward one's perfection of bushido, is all-important for a samurai, who will go to any length to maintain and uphold it. Should a samurai bring shame to himself or his master, he is allowed to take his own life in an act of ritualistic suicide, allowing him to die with his honor intact. For a samurai, death is preferable to dishonor.\\nCreating: Samurai are overwhelmingly drawn to classes that emphasize weapon prowess. The fighter class has the physical fortitude and skill at arms that are the hallmarks of the samurai; however, cultural and environmental aspects of the setting are sometimes best addressed by the talents of other classes. For instance, in realms that wage perpetual war, samurai often become warlords, while those realms on the frontier find the resourcefulness of the ranger to be an important trait for samurai. Exceptionally cultured or mystical lands welcome samurai of arcane or divine classes as well, so long as the individual is able to wield a sword bravely when the time comes.

There is a saying in Kozakura: “The nail that sticks up must be hammered down.” The yakuza proudly view themselves as these nails, but refuse to be treated as such.\\n\\tAlthough the true nature of the yakuza is hard to identify, most will agree that collectively they are scoundrels who live by their own rules and code of honor. Banding together in clannish groups, yakuza gain security and power by exploiting society through robbery or extortion. Most are viewed as criminals, but not necessarily with distaste; the unusual behavior of the yakuza makes them both loved and despised in the cities in which they operate.\\n\\tYakuza often work as street peddlers, smugglers, thugs, gamblers, or racketeers. They associate with each other through bonds of loyalty to their clan, which might include hundreds of members. Yakuza clans are highly organized using a hierarchical structure with the boss taking on the role of father and his subordinates the obedient children. Loyalty and honor are paramount to yakuza, though they eschew the ethics of bushido in favor of more pragmatic concerns.\\n\\tIn the view of most merchants and the officials of cities, yakuza are law-breaking thugs and criminals. The yakuza cultivate their image as iconoclasts, and purposefully commit robberies and vandalism to ruffle the feathers of authority. A yakuza clan often becomes the recognized face of crime within a city, wallowing in a self-made underworld; however, yakuza also realize that their livelihood depends on existing in the shadows of civilization, and they are not unnecessarily destructive of people or property in their criminal enterprises.\\n\\tSome yakuza go so far as to actively attend to the needs of their communities, using resources to help those that the ruling classes have ignored. Many peasants view the yakuza as heroes standing up for the underdog against a society that treads on them. A yakuza clan might defend peasants from bandits or the brutality of an arrogant samurai. Some clans donate wealth to improving the infrastructure of their city. Yakuza have even acted as spies or assassins during times of war to protect their cities from the ravages of loot-hungry attackers. In some cases, these actions are viewed with a standoffish respect by authorities, who allow the yakuza to operate with impunity as long as their criminal activities don't get out of hand.\\nCreating: As outcasts in the society of Kozakura, most yakuza find themselves becoming rogues or assassins in order to survive in the underbelly of civilization. These characters quickly develop the skills and the mind-set that allow them to thrive in this cutthroat environment. Fighters also find a welcome place among yakuza, adopting roles as bodyguards or enforcers who do their bosses' dirty work. Yakuza clans are very inclusive, inclined to welcome anyone cast off from society who can be useful to their organization. As a result, unlikely characters such as clerics, druids, and wizards sometimes find a place within a yakuza clan's ranks. These characters often become vital assets to a clan, their talents giving it an edge over rivals.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Yakuza Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4258\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 404\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"As a yakuza, you don't win battles by going toe-to-toe with enemies: You win by manipulating them into fighting you on your terms.

Many of humanity's oldest folk tales concern these first encounters with creatures such as owlbears and displacer beasts. Although eladrin scholars have tried to disprove the assertion that their ancestors were responsible, there is no doubt that an unusual number of stories passed down by human cultures involve such occurrences.\\n\\tHowever troublesome or malicious the ancient elves might have been, they inadvertently gave the people of the natural world a familiarity with fey creatures. During these formative years for human culture, contact with Feywild beasts had a great impact; the magic of that plane touched hearts and souls in the mortal world. As a result, some members of mortal races developed an affinity for dealing with creatures from the Feywild. They could command the beasts of the fey realm just as mortal nobles could command their subjects. Renowned fey beast tamers, many of whom have been immortalized in story and song, rode into battle with powerful denizens of the Feywild at their side.\\n\\tGenerations passed, empires rose and fell, and wars came and went. Bloodlines that once had been strong were thinned out by centuries of marriage and expansion. The beast tamers who commanded armies of fey creatures died out, and every generation of their offspring grew weaker in their control over fey beasts until the ability was almost forgotten.\\n\\tOnce every few generations, however, a mortal is born of parents who still have strong blood ties to the ancient beast lords. Such individuals grow up with the inherent ability to bond with fey creatures. Though many never realize their full potential, some discover-through chance encounters-that they can influence fey beasts by sheer willpower. These special mortals usually bond with a single creature, forming a connection that is as strong as the one shared by soldiers who serve together in battle.\\n\\tYou are one of these rare individuals with an ability that reaches back to the dawn of civilization. You have formed a connection with a fey creature and can command it to aid you and protect you from harm. Over time, as you develop this bond further, you will begin to absorb the inherent magic of the creature and find yourself capable of things you never thought possible.\"},{\"@name\":\"Fey Beast Tamer Starting Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4191\",\"@source\":\"Heroes of the Feywild\",\"Prereqs\":{\"$\":\"Fey Beast Tamer\"},\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"You have formed a bond with a creature of the Feywild.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\",\"$\":\"1\"},{\"@name\":\"_PARSED_SUB_FEATURES\",\"$\":\"ID_INTERNAL_CLASS_FEATURE_FEY_BEAST_TAMER_STARTING_FEATURE_(BLINK_DOG),ID_INTERNAL_CLASS_FEATURE_FEY_BEAST_TAMER_STARTING_FEATURE_(DISPLACER_BEAST),ID_INTERNAL_CLASS_FEATURE_FEY_BEAST_TAMER_STARTING_FEATURE_(FEY_PANTHER),ID_INTERNAL_CLASS_FEATURE_FEY_BEAST_TAMER_STARTING_FEATURE_(YOUNG_OWLBEAR)\"},{\"@name\":\"_DisplayPowers\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_ASSOCIATE_53,ID_FMP_ASSOCIATE_54,ID_FMP_ASSOCIATE_55,ID_FMP_ASSOCIATE_56\"}],\"rules\":{\"select\":{\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@number\":\"1\",\"@Category\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4191\"},\"$\":\"Choose Fey Beast Minion\"},\"$\":\"Choose one of the following creatures: blink dog, displacer beast, fey panther, or young owlbear.

Whenever an effect requires your fey beast companion to spend a healing surge, the surge is deducted from your total. Whenever you use your second wind, your companion also regains hit points equal to your healing surge value. At the end of a short rest, your fey beast companion regains all its hit points.\\n\\tIf you die or your companion drops below 1 hit point, it retreats back into the Feywild. If that occurs, you can use one of these two ways to call it back.\\n\\tMinor Action: You lose a healing surge, and your companion appears in the nearest unoccupied space, with hit points equal to your healing surge value.\\n\\tShort Rest or Extended Rest: At the end of the rest, you lose a healing surge, and your companion appears in the nearest unoccupied space, with full hit points.\\n  Fey Beast Companion Actions\\n  While you are within 20 squares of your fey beast companion, it relies on your guidance. You take actions so that it can act, and during an encounter its initiative is the same as yours.\\n  Standard Actions: For your fey beast companion to take a standard action, you must take a standard action to command it to do so.\\n  Move Actions: Whenever you take a move action, your fey beast companion can also take a move action. Alternatively, you can stay put but take a move action to command your fey beast companion to take a move action.\\n  Minor Actions: For your fey beast companion to take a minor action, you must take a minor action to command it to do so.\\n  Free Actions: Your fey beast companion can take a free action without your taking an action to command it.\\n  Triggered Actions: If one of your fey beast companion's triggered actions is triggered, the companion can take that action only if you take the same kind of action to command it to do so. For example, if an enemy adjacent to your companion provokes an opportunity attack from it, you must take an opportunity action to command your companion to make the attack.\\n  Acting Independently: In situations when you can't give commands to your fey beast companion, it can act independently. For example, if you are unconscious or more than 20 squares away from your companion, it doesn't sit around waiting for you (unless that's what you commanded it to do). A fey beast companion acting independently does not have a full complement of actions on its turn. Instead, on its turn, it can take a standard action, a move action, or a minor action.

The various fey courts, including the Summer Queen's Court of Stars, are made up of representatives from these houses. Although the houses vary in makeup, goals, and methods, their members are collectively known as Sidhe lords-a title that paints them all with the same brush.\\n\\tThe first true Sidhe lords were elves who lived before the great conflict that splintered the race into three factions. In the days when the race was in its youth, some ambitious elves claimed dominion over the untamed Feywild. When none could challenge them, these early Sidhe lords established themselves as pillars of power in the realm, and an order was born among the fey races. The common people showed deference to the Sidhe lords, and the lords protected those within their dominion.\\n\\tLater, as the people of the Feywild matured and the elf race split into elves, eladrin, and drow, a greater variety of Sidhe lords rose to prominence. Most of these were individuals of other races, such as drow and satyrs, who had gained influence and forged alliances. Rather than engaging in power struggles that could weaken their houses, the established lords acknowledged the new self-proclaimed nobles, giving them legitimacy. To this day, most of the Sidhe lords of the Feywild are eladrin (many of the elf lords took their power bases with them into the natural world), but the newer noble houses have offspring of other races.\\n\\tThe noble houses of the Sidhe lords behave much as their counterparts do in the mortal world; they work together, come into conflict with one another, plot and manipulate, and meddle in the affairs of common people. The fey houses typically choose colors and heraldry the same way that human nobles do, but their symbols are fey creatures such as displacer beasts and owlbears.\\n\\tMost Sidhe lords are eager to associate themselves with dominion over an aspect of the Feywild. The Prince of Frost, for example, claims sovereignty over the Vale of Long Night, and he is known as the Sidhe lord who commands winter (at least, within the Feywild). Other Sidhe lords might hold sway over specific kinds of fey creatures (for example, displacer beasts).\\n\\tFormidable fey nobles make bargains with weaker beings or with those they favor. Sidhe lords have amassed a great deal of influence and arcane might, and a formal pact establishes a bond that allows a lord to transfer that power to a recipient. Many warlocks have such pacts, but Sidhe lords are free to enter into them with all kinds of creatures.\\n\\tYou are a Sidhe lord, a representative of a noble house of the Feywild.

Some say these humans were shapeshifters, born of primal spirits or fey creatures; others say they were the warlike children of a fey goddess. With valor and magic untold, they came from the Feywild in great vessels with sails like white wings. Wielding items of vast power, they conquered all opposing tribes (commingling with some of the elves they subjugated), carved out a realm, and ruled it for centuries. Eventually they fell into decline. The great race receded, its empire crumbled, and it withdrew into the Feywild, leaving behind fragments of glorious epics, hidden troves of magic, and the name of the mighty tribe: Tuatha. \\\"The tribe\\\"-for that is what the word meant in ancient Elven-dispersed throughout the land of the fey, where it is said its descendants remain to this day.\\n\\tNowadays, any human or half-elf born or blessed with a strain of fey magic might be a tuathan. Most tuathans are born in the Feywild, and the bold vibrancy of that realm courses through their veins as it did in the tribe of old. Tuathans born in the mortal world are the result of brief human trysts with beautiful faerie folk. Such children are usually raised by the mortal parent in the natural world, and they grow up with little idea of their enchanted heritage. Deep in their hearts, however, they yearn to strike out into the unknown.\\n\\tTuathans are compelled to experience more wondrous adventures than have ever been told in tales. Perhaps this urge is what drove the conquering Tuatha from the Feywild in ancient times, and perhaps it is the reason the tribe returned to the fey realm after ruling for so long. When tuathans set their sights on a distant horizon, a love to be won, or a challenge to be met, fulfilling the goal occupies their thoughts as intensely as the pangs of first love. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most fairy tales that migrate to the mortal world are stories of the tuathans of the Feywild striving to attain their heart's desire.\\n\\tSome tuathans bear no outward mark of their fey heritage and appear as ordinary humans or halfelves in every aspect. Most appear as slender, exotic individuals with striking, well-defined features and thick, lustrous hair. Their most remarkable physical characteristics are the slight suggestions of fey or animal traits that delicately grace their faces, notably eyes, noses, hair, and ears. Some have eyes like those of cats, eladrin, or owls; others have shining manes of dark hair naturally interwoven with raven, peacock, or eagle feathers; still others have subtly elongated noses or ears suggestive of foxes, cats, or elves. These understated traits appear natural and are rarely noticed at a glance.\\n\\tA few tuathans are fey shapechangers, able to transform into the beasts or birds that their normal features suggest. In ancient tales, shapechangers served tuathan kings and queens as explorers, spies, and court magic users. Today, such individuals travel the Feywild as trader nomads. They visit villages, towns, and cities of the natural world to give mortals a spark of magic in their lives-but always for a price.\\n\\tA vow or a bargain made with a tuathan is binding and cannot be broken without consequences, which are often magical. Tuathans believe that powerful enchantments are inherent in spoken stories, vows, bargains, rhymes, names, songs, and chants. For a tuathan, to say a thing is to give it life, to make it real.\\n\\tTuathans believe that nothing in the world is unobtainable, and when they accept a challenge, they seldom back down from it. They pursue their aims to the ends of the world, for it is by the magnitude of their deeds that they will be remembered in song and story through the ages, like the Tuatha of old.\\n\\tTuathan naming conventions date back to the time of the ancient tribe. Most of the names bestowed upon children have their roots in the land from which Tuatha set sail. Popular male names include Bran, Cadeyrn, Dylan, Eogan, Gawain, Iago, Lugh, Maedoc, Merrion, Morcant, Padraig, Roderick, Taliesin, Trystan, Urien, and Wynn. Females are often called Alis, Anwen, Blaithin, Cara, Ceridwen, Elain, Fflur, Glynis, Gwendolyn, Gwyneth, Keelie, Kendal, Megann, Morrigan, Rowena, or Sioned.\"},{\"@name\":\"Tuathan Starting Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4197\",\"@source\":\"Heroes of the Feywild\",\"Prereqs\":{\"$\":\"Tuathan\"},\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"Gain either Continue the Story or Shapechanger Physique\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\",\"$\":\"1\"},{\"@name\":\"_PARSED_SUB_FEATURES\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4198, ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4199\"}],\"rules\":{\"select\":{\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@number\":\"1\",\"@Category\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4197\"}},\"$\":\"You gain either Continue the Story or Shapechanger Physique.\"},{\"@name\":\"Continue the Story\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4198\",\"@source\":\"Heroes of the Feywild\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4197,1\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"The tale of a tuathan does not end arbitrarily.

At best, these dark fey, or Unseelie, are indifferent about the harm they cause with their actions. At worst, they are creatures that carry the taint of shadow magic and seek to snuff out the light of the world.\\n\\tDespite their reputation, these fey attract outsiders seeking their favor-some people just cannot resist the lure of dark magic. The Unseelie are well versed in the shadowy arts and, like many other fey creatures, love the power of bargains. They haggle and barter for what they have to offer, sometimes taking more than the seeker wants to pay in exchange.\\n\\tYou are one such seeker. You came to an Unseelie fey creature in search of knowledge, favors, a weapon, a charm, or something else. The asking price was too high, so you pledged yourself into your patron's service instead. As is the case with many fey pledges, the duration of your service seems open to interpretation. In the meantime, you act as an agent of your patron well beyond the borders of its dominion.\\n\\tThe tasks that your Unseelie master asks you to perform do not seem suspicious, and they follow no pattern that you have been able to discern. In fact, most of what you are called to do seems trivial- delivering messages, transporting money or goods, and reporting back on individuals that you observe. Your patron has yet to ask you to do something truly odious, although you realize that such a request might be made one day.\\n\\tIn exchange for your service, your Unseelie patron bestows gifts upon you. At the outset of your bargain, your patron gave you a shadow-wrought weapon, a magic item that cements the bond between you. In addition, your master occasionally teaches you small magic tricks or gives you insight into the workings of higher fey powers, expanding your knowledge and expertise.

Dragoon is a special title awarded to individuals who have shown exceptional service to the crown.\\n\\tUnlike knights of the realm, dragoons do not muster with the realm's army but instead receive assignments best handled alongside a small number of compatriots. As such, Callidyrr dragoons receive specialized training in diplomacy and espionage. Dragoons have access to the Palace of the High King and can speak with royal authority throughout the realm. In exchange for these privileges, a dragoon must swear a binding oath of unwavering allegiance to the High King and the land. The Royal Hierophant administers this oath and seals it with a geas that binds the dragoon to the honored ancestors. If the dragoon ever forsakes the vows to king and country, the geas irrevocably wipes the fallen dragoon of his memories.\\n\\tThe rank of dragoon is relatively new, having been born of the nation's conflict with Amn at the dawn of the century. After repeated failed attempts to forcibly liberate the kingdom of Westphal from Amnian occupation, High Queen Alicia Kendrick founded the dragoons to work against the Amnian invaders clandestinely.\\n\\tWhen the High Queen died unexpectedly in the Year of the Halls Unhaunted (1407 DR), the dragoons were instrumental in quelling insurgent uprisings throughout Callidyrr. Common belief held that agents of Lionel Carrathal, heir to the former royal dynasty of Callidyrr who claimed to be the “true” High King of the Moonshaes, poisoned the beloved High Queen.\\n\\tIn the years since, the dragoons have thwarted countless assassins, driven off sahuagin incursions, and even brokered a tenuous peace with the fey of Sarifal.

The presence of the Wild Hunt is felt most strongly in the Feywild, but it sometimes appears in the natural world. No qualification or ritual is necessary to join the Wild Hunt. A rider might be a member of a hunting tribe in either the Feywild or the natural world, a normal person swept up in the glory of the hunt, or someone who made a deal with an impetuous fey lord. When the Wild Hunt appears, each of its riders suddenly vanishes from the world and becomes a member of the horde wherever it might be. The rider reappears at his or her former location days or weeks later with little memory of what happened-just flashes of rage and hunger, embodying the thrill of the hunt. No one on the hunt ever remembers what was being hunted or why.\\n\\tFirbolgs, giant-sized hunters from the Feywild, make up much of the rank and file of the hunt. When the firbolgs accept a Wild Hunt rider into their numbers, that individual also becomes an honorary member of the tribe. This is not a choice the firbolgs make; they simply sense that the rider belongs. The hunt is driven by a deeper magic that follows no rules mortals can understand, and those in the hunt know better than to try.\\nCreating: The Wild Hunt selects its riders; no one can join the hunt by seeking it out. Rangers, barbarians, druids, and other primal characters could easily find themselves swept up by the call of the hunt, but any sort of other character could discover just how strong his or her hidden instincts to hunt and kill truly are.\\n\\tCharacters who have much in common with firbolgs might end up in the hunt.

This ritual-known to the fomorians, some of their servants, and a scattered few hags and spellcasters-takes hours to perform and is extremely painful, involving burning oils, foul incense, and surgical incisions. Fomorians, well known for their wickedness and insanity, might order that the ritual be conducted for many reasons. A ruler might give an evil eye as a gift to a faithful servant one day, then issue one as a punishment to a prisoner the next.\\n\\tOnly the cruelest creatures consider gaining an evil eye to be a blessing. Evil fey such as quicklings and spriggans thrill at the power of an evil eye, and eagerly do the work of the fomorians in exchange for such a blessing.\\n\\tMost oracles of the evil eye who undertake adventuring careers are gnomes or eladrin. Forced to undergo the ritual, they become outcasts from their home societies. They go off into the woods of the Feywild, never to be seen again, or they travel to the natural world to lurk on the fringes of society and use their evil eyes to get what they want. An oracle of the evil eye might be adventuring in search of a way to dispel the curse and return to the warmth and comfort of society.\\nCreating: Oracles usually come from races hated by the fomorians, particularly gnomes or eladrin. However, anyone who has spent time in the fomorians' underground realms could have been subjected to the Baleful Ritual of the Evil Eye. The magic has even made its way into the hands of creatures outside the fomorians' domain.

Scoundrels of the highest order, these cunning, untrustworthy villains exploit, betray, and deceive, having little concern for the people they hurt and the lives they destroy. Knaves encompass a wide range of characters, from the charlatan foisting colored water off as a cure for ills to the charming rake who steals hearts and purses in equal numbers. Turncoats, bandits, and public figures might be knaves in secret, masking their true intentions behind facades.\\n\\tOne does not make a career of double-crossing and exploiting people without risking consequences. Rather than advertise their villainy, many knaves go to great lengths to stay above suspicion. A good disguise is sometimes all a knave needs. Fabricating a history, adding possible relations, and becoming established in a community gives the knave freedom to pursue his or her goals. Others work their trickery by being exceptional liars. A ready story and a convincing manner can divert a skeptic's attention elsewhere.\\n\\tBlack-hearted knaves don't put down roots. No matter how many safeguards they have in place, a simple gaffe or a glimmer of recognition by a prior victim is all it sometimes takes to expose a knave for what he or she truly is. Adventuring provides a knave with a ready excuse to move from place to place. Between expeditions, he or she works schemes in whatever town or hamlet that has the bad fortune to serve as a host to the knave. Then, before anyone grows the wiser about what has been done, he or she moves off, drawn toward the next dungeon and adventure.\\n\\tThe black-hearted knave lurks among almost every people and culture. The selfishness and cruelty required to become a black-hearted knave are in no way unique to any class or race; such peculiar villainy owes its origin to some terrible circumstance that set the individual on darkness's path. An ordinary man or woman might turn to skulduggery after being used by another villain in the past, thus becoming embittered and cynical. A hard life on the streets can corrupt one's good intentions and stain a soul with darkness.\\n\\t\\n\\tMost knaves benefit from strong personalities. Witty or menacing, inspiring or magnetic, they manipulate people around them. The talents of the bard make such characters eminently suited to become black-hearted knaves. Not only do they have the requisite charisma, but they can supplement their devious nature with manipulative spells to ensure that people around them behave as they wish. Rogues also possess skills and exploits that are perfect for expressing and reinforcing the knave's preferred methods.\\n\\tOther characters can also do well as knaves. Fey pact warlocks and enchanters incorporate magic into their techniques whereby they bend minds to their wills. A power-mad sorcerer might sacrifice others to hoard magical knowledge and baubles, while a disgraced knight or paladin could use a knave's techniques to make his or her way in the world after some public shame.

After all, cults honor a higher power, a greater good, or a treasured ideal.\\n\\tWhat sets a cult apart from other religious institutions is a fundamentally bad belief, a perception about the cosmos that is diametrically opposed to those held by right-thinking folk. A cult's creed could be based on an extraordinary interpretation of a god (any god, even a good one) that compels certain sinister practices in their worship. Another cult might elevate a demon lord, monstrous alien, or dark power to divine status. Cults could be founded by devotees of beings that exist only in their minds. Such strange and deviant belief breeds dangerous behaviors and attracts the attention of forces that champion the good. As a result, most cults are driven underground.\\n\\tCults spring up regularly the world over. Fear, uncertainty, and dissatisfaction foment offbeat beliefs and unwholesome ideas about how the world works and what the future holds. Cult leaders prey on doubts and superstition, drawing the disaffected and the despairing under their inf luence. One by one, adherents are brought under the cult's sway, abandoning families and work to find the salvation promised by following the one true path.\\n\\tFew cults subscribe to peace and harmony. Such rewards must be earned, a task that is impossible to realize in the present state of affairs. Therefore, cults are subversive societies, working against governments and widespread faiths, all to attain whatever objective the cult was founded to achieve.\\nBuilding a Cultist: When you choose the cultist character theme, spend some time thinking about the group and your affiliation. Work with your Dungeon Master to come up with a suitably interesting and dark society. Be sure to establish who or what it is that you serve and what it wants. Then, think about how you came to be part of the cult. How were you recruited? What were you promised? Once you joined, what responsibilities were you assigned? Are you one of the leaders or a devoted specialist follower? Have the higher-ups in the cult revealed the full extent of its power, or do they keep things hidden from you? Have your beliefs evolved since joining? Are you just as fervent as you were or have you become jaded about the organization?\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Cultist Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4218\",\"@source\":\"The Book of Vile Darkness\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Short Description\",\"$\":\"Gain the master's eye power\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\",\"$\":\"1\"},{\"@name\":\"Powers\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_15935\"},{\"@name\":\"Type\",\"$\":\"Encounter\"},{\"@name\":\"Class\"},{\"@name\":\"_DisplayPowers\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_15935\"}],\"rules\":{\"grant\":{\"@name\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_15935\",\"@type\":\"Power\"}},\"$\":\"You gain the master's eye power.\"},{\"@name\":\"Master's Eye\",\"@type\":\"Power\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_POWER_15935\",\"@source\":\"The Book of Vile Darkness\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"ID_INTERNAL_CATEGORY_ATTACK,ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4218,ID_INTERNAL_CATEGORY_ENCOUNTER,ID_INTERNAL_CATEGORY_ENCOUNTER_USAGE,ID_FMP_CATEGORY_38,ID_INTERNAL_CATEGORY_MINOR_ACTION\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"Your obsequious call draws attention to your deeds, risking your master's ire if you fail.\"},\"specific\":[{\"@name\":\"Power Usage\",\"$\":\"Encounter\"},{\"@name\":\"Display\",\"$\":\"Cultist Attack\"},{\"@name\":\"Keywords\",\"$\":\"Shadow\"},{\"@name\":\"Action Type\",\"$\":\"Minor Action\"},{\"@name\":\"Attack Type\",\"$\":\"Personal\"},{\"@name\":\"Effect\",\"$\":\"If you make an attack this turn and hit with your first attack roll, the creature you hit takes 1d8 extra damage from that attack, and you gain 5 temporary hit points.\\n\\tIf the attack roll misses, or if you do not attack this turn, you grant combat advantage and are deafened until the end of your next turn.\\n\\tLevel 11: 10 temporary hit points.\\n\\tLevel 21: 15 temporary hit points.\"},{\"@name\":\"Class\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_THEME_923\"},{\"@name\":\"Level\"},{\"@name\":\"Power Type\",\"$\":\"Attack\"},{\"@name\":\"_ParentFeature\",\"$\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4218\"}],\"$\":\"All that you do, you do for your dark master.

Whether the decision was made after careful consideration or in the heat of passion, the infernal slave agrees to sacrifice the future-a dimly understood afterlife, a shadowy doom not yet realized-in exchange for some immediate gain.\\n\\tThe boon could be something as base as wealth. Treasure chests filled to bursting, a prized jewel long coveted, a successful business venture: all translate into mortal comfort. The gain could be satisfaction of lust, carnal, material, or otherwise-a longing that would not be denied. The greatest lure, however, is power. Command over other people is intoxicating, as is the ability to do as one wishes without fear, without persecution, without regard for consequences.\\n\\tThese prizes are great temptations. To the infernal slave, they are immediate and full recompense for a sacrifice payable far off in the future. Some claim that the slave is doomed to an unspeakable fate, suffering and dying a thousand deaths at the hands of the cosmos's most vile entities, those god-killers called devils. But what do the naysayers truly know. Maybe the consequences are far less dire. One never knows what the future holds. Given the immediacy of the boon and the remoteness (and sheer conjecture) of the payment, the infernal slave considers the arrangement a true bargain.\\n\\tIn the end, an infernal slave comes to understand that he or she has bargained badly. The boon turns out to be fleeting, ruined by personal choice or circumstance. The bargainer becomes worse off than he or she was prior to making the deal. In this wretched state, the full horror of the pact is revealed and annihilation's imminence bears down with a hammer's force. The slave sees his or her doom in the shadows, hears the screaming souls as they burn in hellfire-a waking nightmare that never ends.\\n\\tAt that point, panic and horror shape the slave's existence. Escaping this fate comes to eclipse any other consideration. In this way, the devils gain a mortal thrall-a vessel to spread evil and corruption. Evil appears the only way out for the misguided fool who desperately seeks to escape the doom he or she willfully accepted.\\nCreating: As usual when choosing a theme, several questions should be asked.

Inheritors of a hellish strength, these infernal princes can call upon an array of diabolical abilities.\\n\\tAlthough many infernal lords have engendered mortal bloodlines, Asmodeus and Mephistopheles have been the most prolific. Infernal princes who can trace their lineage back to either archdevil are by far the most common of their ilk, and both Asmodeus and Mephistopheles actively involve themselves in the lives of their progeny. An infernal prince might be unaware that his or her blood and soul churns with the essence of an archdevil, and the diabolical power resulting from this union typically lies dormant until the character reaches young adulthood.\\n\\tIn the case of an infernal prince bearing the blood of Asmodeus or Mephistopheles, a tutor sent by the archdevil arrives when the dark urges that herald a diabolical awakening manifest in that individual. This tutor is often a cleric or a warlock devoted to the archdevil, and his or her first order of business is to remove the fledgling prince from home and the influence of parents, who remain unaware of their child's ancestry because, for whatever reason, their own potential was never great enough to warrant the attention of an archdevil. The tutor's goal is to ensure that the student embraces his or her heritage and serves the archdevil whose blood flows through his or her veins. An infernal prince is still mortal, however, and the decision to embrace evil and follow in the footsteps of one's progenitors is his or hers to make. An individual must consciously choose the diabolical path to gain access to its power.\\n\\tInfernal princes can rise high in the service of the archdevil whose blood they share, and they are quite skilled at leading other mortals into darkness. Within an adventuring party, an infernal prince plays the part of a committed comrade and takes pains to keep his or her true allegiance a secret. The character works to lead companions into wickedness, subtly pushing them to commit acts of evil that seem innocuous but form a slippery slope into spiritual corruption. Once these companions are committed to evil, the infernal prince inducts them into the service of his or her patriarch, swelling the ranks of mortals who serve the interests of the Nine Hells.\\nCreating: Infernal princes come from many walks of life, since the lords of the Nine Hells value a diverse set of skills and powers.

Those of noble lineage are expected to take the oath and typically are trained for positions of leadership, while those of a common bloodline sign up for two years of service in the militia and undergo extensive training.\\n\\tA lucky few are accepted as squires to Purple Dragon Knights. A squire's crest is emblazoned on a background of the liege's color, and these backgrounds are as numerous as the shades of the rainbow, though the purple dragon crest is never displayed on a black field. Those in direct service to the royal family and those who do not serve a particular noble bear their crests on a white background.\\n\\tPurple Dragons' training consists of three schools of focus. The young and fearless begin their study by learning attack techniques that bring the fight to the enemy. Those who dream of advancing through the ranks to take positions of leadership study tactics to best take advantage of the battlefield. The most respected are those who train to protect key personnel, especially War Wizards, and do not hesitate to sacrifice themselves for the greater cause. Regardless of role, the Purple Dragons train to fight together as a unit. Loyalty, duty, and honor are valued above all else, and a unit of Purple Dragons can operate as a single machine, utilizing the strengths of the working whole over the individual weaknesses of each component.\\n\\tPurple Dragons spend six months in extensive training. They are then assigned to a specific location to continue training while on active duty. Some receive assignments to serve in a major city and maintain the king's law; the largest such garrisons are in Suzail and Marsember. Others maintain border patrols as a first line of defense against Cormyr's enemies. After two years of service, some Purple Dragons choose the defense of Cormyr and enforcement of her laws as a career, but most return to their homes and professions until the need arises for them to bear arms in the name of the king. A rare few become adventurers, honing their skills so that they can be at their best when they are called back into service.\\nCreating: Loyalty to crown and country are paramount for a Purple Dragon, so there are no restrictions on class or race for citizens of Cormyr, who are mostly human. Non-native races often need to demonstrate their loyalty to prove their intentions before taking the oath.\\n\\tThe Purple Dragons welcome any of good or lawful good alignment who take the oath to serve Cormyr and her king above all personal desires, and those who vow to protect all citizens of Cormyr.

Most brash recruits begin their study with attack forms, advancing wildly and forcefully to bring down their opponents quickly.

Those who truly master the craft might be invited to join the order of Cormyr's War Wizards, the elite battle casters sworn to the crown of Cormyr.\\n\\tThe War Wizards of Cormyr are a secretive group. They realize that if the secrets they discover are shared only with those within their ranks, they gain an edge over their enemies. They reveal some of these secrets through research, and they find others in long-lost tomes of lore. Many War Wizards send their battle mage apprentices out with adventurers, with strict instructions to return and share any ancient secrets they might uncover. Like Purple Dragons, War Wizards and battle mages must swear an oath of fealty to Cormyr before training begins.\\n\\tMost battle mages are recruited as children when they show aptitude after being introduced to arcane theories or if they exhibit a natural talent for the arcane art. Some students who excel at their studies after being recruited are tested by a War Wizard and, if special talent is identified, they are taken from their families to learn at the War Wizard Academy. Only a few of those who achieve the mastery of basic arcane practices are admitted to the academy formally and are assigned to a particular War Wizard as an apprentice. The others are returned to their families. Having one's child selected to study with the War Wizards is considered a great honor.\\n\\tOnce admitted, an apprentice spends five years studying the basic tenets of wizardry. Over half cannot achieve the high standards set by the War Wizards and are dismissed. After five years of successful study, an apprentice gains the benefits and official title of battle mage. He or she then studies additional secrets unique to the War Wizards.\\n\\tA few adults petition the War Wizards for an apprenticeship to learn their secrets and master their craft. The War Wizards are suspicious of such requests and turn away those who have not gained the full trust of the crown or proven themselves loyal citizens. Petitioners must undergo a series of divinations and other tests to verify their intentions. They must also prove their value to the organization by providing new knowledge of the arcane arts or by teaching a new and useful spell. Only then can a practicing wizard or sorcerer become the apprentice of a War Wizard. The expectations for all battle mages are the same, regardless of age.\\n\\tAfter becoming a battle mage, some thus titled request a sabbatical to travel the world so that they can learn mystical secrets to bring back to the organization and strengthen it.\\nCreating: Loyalty to crown and country is paramount for a battle mage. However, the War Wizards must also find value in the arcane arts that the apprentice brings to their organization. Only sorcerers and wizards can become Cormyrian battle mages.\\n\\tAny unaligned, good, or lawful good wizard or sorcerer who takes the oath to serve the realm, her king, and the War Wizards of Cormyr can become a Cormyrian battle mage. Breaking this oath is considered treason, and the organization will go to great lengths to prevent exmembers from revealing its secrets, most of which involve shaping spells on the battlefield and empowering spells to damage Cormyr's enemies.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Cormyrian Battle Mage Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4423\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 407\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"Cormyrian battle mages gain a basic understanding of the philosophy and tenets of the War Wizards. They do not study magic for the sake of arcane knowledge, but focus specifically on how they can enhance magic in battle.\\nThe first stage of study is to learn to defend oneself from attacks while casting. A battle mage can cast spells quickly and gracefully without lowering defenses.\\nNext, battle mages must understand how combat ebbs and flows. They learn to recognize the value of each combatant in a battle and learn to use their spells to destroy the enemy while not hindering their own forces. It is rare for battle mages to fight a lone battle or a wizard's duel, since their purpose is to enhance the Purple Dragons of Cormyr. Personal glory is of little interest to War Wizards, and they instill this outlook within their battle mage apprentices. Value is placed on honing one's instincts to react to a changing battlefield and shaping spells to avoid allies while devastating enemy forces.\\nFinally, each battle mage is taught to be alert at all times. Many tactical tomes advise that taking out the enemy's leadership and spellcasters first is the best way to win a battle. While engaged in conflict, battle mages are aware that they are high-value targets, and they do whatever it takes to protect themselves from harm.

Contracted to pursue criminals across national borders and beyond into uncivilized realms, they are an international police force dispensed by House Deneith. The Sentinel Marshals hold a reputation of honor, courage, and neutrality unrivaled by traditional chivalric agencies. Where royal courts, churches, and noble houses produce knights sworn to feudal lords, House Deneith produces knights sworn to the immortal ideology of a vanished kingdom. Their devotion to justice is second to none.\\n\\tThe life of a Sentinel Marshal is far from easy, and even the men and women who meet its formidable standards seldom choose it. Most marshals travel constantly, work alone, and regularly cross blades with ruthless outlaws. More than mere soldiers of House Deneith, they are agents of justice and the law, warrior-diplomats who traverse physical and political hazards every day.\\n\\tSentinel Marshals aren't flawless in their actions. They are, however, expected to be.\\n\\t\\nHistory and Marshal Law:\\nNearly a thousand years ago, King Galifar III instructed the patriarch of House Deneith to form an elite order numbering no more than three hundred swords to assist the Galifar Guard in upholding the law. Further charged with bringing fugitives to justice, the Sentinel Marshals were assembled from the most venerated heirs of the house and became well known throughout the great kingdom. Many of these noble warriors were household names who others looked up to or feared.\\n\\tWhere House Deneith was Galifar's shield, the Sentinel Marshals had become its blazing sword, striking down enemies of the realm within and without. Upon the death of King Jarot in 894 YK and the dispute over his succession, House Deneith and the Marshals struggled to smother the sparks of war. But when bloodshed could not be quelled and the Last War raged in earnest, the Marshals turned their efforts to the conduct of the war and universal observance of the Galifar Code of Justice, hoping to restore order when the kingdom was reunited.\\n\\tGalifar was not restored. Under the Treaty of Thronehold in 996 YK, which ended the centurylong conflict, the Marshals retained their role as officers of the Code. They were granted the right to cross national boundaries-hard lines that now divided the continent-to enforce the laws of the Code and punish those who defied it.\\n\\tAs a branch of the world's most powerful mercenary organization, the Sentinel Marshals operate by contract. Although they are authorized to enact justice beyond the auspices of the dragonmarked houses, enforcing the Code of Galifar and even the Korth Edicts, they are not above the law.\\n\\tAt first blush, Marshals-who are hired to capture or kill outlaws-might seem comparable to bounty hunters, but they live by an imperial oath and high moral standards. Yet Marshals are not expected to work for free; they might serve the ideals of justice, but the lords of Deneith earn lots of coin in the process.\\n\\tMarshals cannot be hired for just any mission. Only proven criminals or malevolent monsters are pursued, and if there is any doubt as to the target's guilt, Marshals might be instructed to arrest, not slay, their quarry. They are enforcers hired to track down criminals, not to determine guilt or solve mysteries, and yet justice is not always so easily served. Sometimes it begets investigation, and many Marshals, becoming invested in their work, make an effort to look beyond the obvious or readily apparent.\\n\\tToday, fewer than two hundred Sentinel Marshals exist. Only nine reside regularly in Sharn, the City of Towers, with three or four stationed in most major cities of Khorvaire at any given time. Their central offices are located in Sentinel Tower in the city of Karrlakton, and all Marshals inevitably return there to report, train, or receive new assignments.\\n\\t\\nMarshals and the Code:\\nThe jurisdiction of the Sentinel Marshals is extensive but not without limit. The Galifar Code of Justice recognizes and protects the twelve sovereign nations acknowledged by the Treaty of Thronehold. Beyond these lands-in places such as Droaam, the Shadow Marches, and Xen'drik-a Sentinel Marshal carries only as much authority as he or she can exert. For example, a Marshal has the right to apprehend a criminal in Stormreach if the crime was committed on Brelish soil, but the Marshal should expect no support from the Storm Lords.\\n\\tThe Code of Galifar includes laws that forbid murder, theft, assault, fraud, smuggling, dueling, the misuse of magic, and even treasure hunting without a letter of marque. Resisting arrest carries steep penalties, and Host save the criminal who dares to kill a Sentinel Marshal. The full wrath of the law will follow such a wrongdoer for life.\\n\\tThe Code does not protect all creatures. It does not cover criminals (who forfeit all rights), the undead, and citizens of nations not recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold. For example, slaying a shifter from Graywall in the city of Sharn carries no penalty. The killing is not considered murder in the eyes of the Code because Droaam is not a sovereign nation.\\n\\t\\nA Marshal's Career Path:\\nNot everyone can become a Sentinel Marshal. Under normal circumstances, only blood members of House Deneith qualify. A dragonmark is not required, but those who possess one enjoy a measure of esteem that their peers must work harder to achieve.\\n\\tAn heir of Deneith who aspires to become a Marshal usually begins as a member of the Blademarks Guild, then transfers to the Defenders Guild. Exemplary performance in both of those services earns an applicant consideration as a full-fledged Sentinel Marshal. A proven soldier must demonstrate honor, obedience to the chain of command, and dedication to the Galifar Code of Justice. Exceptions to this career path can be made, but only with direct sponsorship by one of the ruling lords of Sentinel Tower. Ultimately, it is merit, not age or family connections, that determines a Marshal's status. All Sentinel Marshals report to the Lords Seneschal and, nominally, to Baron Breven.\\n\\t\\nSigns of Authority:\\nA Sentinel Marshal is required to identify herself and her office when making an arrest. The uniform of a Marshal is a black or purple surcoat worn over armor. The cloth is sewn with silver thread and emblazoned with elements of the Deneith crest. Marshals are not required to wear this uniform at all times, but it's helpful when one needs to invoke one's authority.\\n\\tFor times out of uniform, each Marshal is issued an elaborate badge of office. For one, it might be a special document sealed in a metal case. For another, it might be a brooch displaying the chimera heads of the Deneith coat of arms and worn as a cloak pin.\\n\\tWhen a Marshal has demonstrated exceptional service, her superiors might give her an honor blade. Honor blades represent the glory of House Deneith and the special veneration of the Sentinel Marshals. Such weapons are never sold, and a Sentinel Marshal who finds an honor blade in the possession of anyone other than a Marshal is required to recover it.\\n\\t\\nAdventuring Marshals:\\nSentinel Marshals undertake many types of missions and have many reasons to travel. They receive assignments within Deneith enclaves throughout Khorvaire and sometimes beyond, such as in the house's Stormreach enclave. Between missions, a Marshal's time is her own. She can travel with allies provided that she checks in at Deneith outposts whenever possible.\\n\\tIn times of crisis, Sentinel Marshals have the power to deputize worthy allies-especially other warriors or other members of House Deneith-to assist them. This title does not grant allies the full authority of a Sentinel Marshal, but it legitimizes their presence and recognizes their aid if the mission is later scrutinized. Depending on the circumstances, a Marshal's allies might be debriefed afterward, rewarded for their efforts, and asked to help again.\\n\\tA typical assignment for a Sentinel Marshal is to find (and kill, if necessary) a known and dangerous criminal. Such criminals are usually of the worst sort-the ones who leave town, consort with unsavory fellow outlaws, make fiendish alliances, and don't play fair.\\n\\tSentinel Marshals are also special operatives, not just law officers. One might be asked to assist in a diplomatic mission to Droaam, seize a shipment of Xen'drik relics from pirates on the Thunder Sea, or save an Eldeen village from a dragon roused by the Lords of Dust.\\n\\tHaving a Sentinel Marshal in the party provides an excellent plot device for the DM. Marshals also receive pay and rewards for each job they take, which is a means for your DM to deliver treasure. Baron Breven d'Deneith might have special items in his vaults or connections that can be used to reveal where such items might be found.\\n\\tThe missions assigned to you, as an adventuring Marshal, are suitable for your skills and those of your known associates and regular deputies. If you are a rogue, you might be ordered to infiltrate a thieves' guild and slay the vampire lord that rules it. If you are a fighter, you might be sent to defeat an ettin terrorizing Breland's western borders.\\n\\tYou're not always on duty, so you can go on adventures that have nothing do with your house. Nor are you required to chase down a cutpurse in the streets or arrest a merchant you see committing fraud unless you've been hired to do so. Yet you retain the right to enact justice whenever you deem it necessary. Some Marshals are callous about their authority, enforcing the law only in certain cases or when they're required to do so. Others cannot stand idle when they witness even the pettiest crimes. It's up to you to decide where you fall on the spectrum of justice.\\n\\tRemember that you don't have to kill every foe. Sometimes you're the good guy who drags the bad guys back to the city to face the music. But just as often, you need to be the judge, jury, and executioner who gets the job done by any means necessary. Usually, a fugitive's head is proof enough that he's no longer a threat.\\nCreating: Often, someone who seeks and gains admission to the Marshals spends his or her first few levels serving as a Blademark mercenary or a bodyguard in the employ of the Defenders Guild. For such a character, full-fledged membership in the Marshals might not be attainable before he or she reaches the middle of the heroic tier.\\n\\tThat said, exceptions are possible. A 1st-level Sentinel Marshal in full standing probably has received special treatment, has strong family connections within House Deneith, and is dragonmarked. Such hasty advancement, though, could foster resentment among other Marshals and might present a roleplaying challenge.\\n\\tOnly humans can be blood members of House Deneith, so Sentinel Marshals are always human. But again, the DM can make exceptions. A character of another race, if a loyal and long-standing servant of House Deneith, or one that bears the Mark of Sentinel, can earn honorary membership in the Sentinel Marshals with the approval of Baron Breven. Of course, a nonhuman Marshal might be regarded as an outsider among her peers.\\n\\tThe Sentinel Marshal theme lends itself to characters who use the martial power source. Fighters, as skilled defenders able to go toe to toe with formidable enemies, are most common among Sentinel Marshals. Paladins, as defenders devoted to high ideals, also make excellent Marshals, although many struggle to balance their religious and secular duties. Rangers and rogues, trained to focus on a single quarry, are a good fit as well. Members of other classes, such as avengers and warlocks, are good at singling out specific foes and also work well as Marshals.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 The Sentinel Marshal Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4432\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 407\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"Bearing the honor of House Deneith and the legacy of nearly a thousand years of tradition, you do not hesitate to invoke your authority.

Demons live to destroy everything they can until they are destroyed themselves. This violent behavior makes it rare for demons to consort with mortals, yet here and there across the planes, one can find mortals who have demonic blood flowing through\\ntheir veins. Called demon spawn, most such creatures display wild, destructive evil similar to that of their demonic sires.\\n\\tUnraveling the mystery of how demon spawn come to exist requires some background about how mortal races interact with the Abyss. Lolth instructed her chosen people in demonology ages ago, and her priestesses sometimes call forth demons to sire draegloths with willing initiates. Similar ceremonies might be found in other dark societies. Other kinds of demon spawn descend from incubi. Sages believe that incubi were devils that followed Graz'zt into the Abyss when he sought to conquer its first layer. Despite their new home, these incubi retain their basic nature, and they still trouble the natural world with nocturnal visitations that sometimes result in demon-blooded children. However, because the Abyss changes and corrupts all it touches, the most common way that demon spawn come into existence is through exposure to abyssal energy.\\n\\tFew demon spawn show evidence of their demonic heritage as soon as they are born. In fact, most look like normal mortal children, visually unremarkable. The transformation might start gradually, first with small horns breaking the skin on the forehead and later vestigial bat wings emerging from the shoulder blades. Demon spawn who conceal or downplay these features can avoid attracting attention or, if they desire, pass as tieflings.\\nCreating: Some demon spawn are little more than ravening monsters that wreak havoc in the world until some hero puts them down. A rare few find ways to control the corrupting influence that consumes them and channel it in constructive ways. Demon spawn are apt warriors, favoring classes that let them engage in hand-to-hand combat. Their unholy heritage makes them unpredictable in battle and, as the fighting rages on, they can lose the ability to distinguish clearly between friend and foe. For this reason, they focus less on defense and more on offense. Few warriors can match the ferocity that a demon spawn barbarian, ranger, or fighter displays.\"},{\"@name\":\"Demon Spawn Starting Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4283\",\"@source\":\"Heroes of the Elemental Chaos\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"Your demonic heritage reveals itself in your flesh and in your wild temper.

Earthforgers wield great power, but such ability comes at an even greater price. When they grasp this elemental magic and take it in, earthforgers are reborn as elemental creatures.\\n\\tDwarves pioneered the techniques of earthforging long ago; many sages believe that the race's first steps toward mastering elemental power occurred when the dwarves were enslaved by the giants, and those efforts led to the birth of the galeb duhr race. While extracting precious metals and gemstones from deep under the mountains, dwarf miners in that long-ago time came across primordial shards, crystallized magic left from creation. Using these shards, the dwarves found they could shape stone more easily, while also being able to endure even greater punishment. An unknown number of dwarves succumbed to elemental power's temptations, losing themselves to its magic, but enough resisted and proved mighty allies in the uprising that led to the dwarves' exodus from cruel enslavement.\\n\\tOther races have stumbled across earthforging under similar circumstances. Goliaths learned to use elemental earth from the stone spirits who watch over their mountain camps. Svirfneblin, gnomes who have long dwelt in the Underdark, use earthforging to evade drow slavers and destroy other hostile humanoids. Travelers report encounters with strange hermits, formerly mortal creatures that have been transformed into beings of living stone. Such individuals are rare, yet anyone who explores the wild places, those untamed lands where the primordials' fingerprints can still be seen, might very well come across an earthforger.\\nCreating: Not only can earthforgers increase their physical might by drawing power from the ground, they can use the same energy to shore up their defenses and resist injury. Some earthforgers pledge to protect others, taking up careers as battleminds or wardens to reflect their singular commitment to safeguarding their charges. In lands where mainstream religions have great sway, earthforgers might conceal their magical abilities, using them to supplement the fighting maneuvers learned from being a knight or a weaponmaster. An earthforger does not often pursue a divine career, but when one does, he or she favors the paladin class and worships Melora, Moradin, or Kord.\\n\\tDwarves, goliaths, and other races with ties to mountains, hills, and subterranean environments have the oldest earthforging traditions, but a member of any race can learn the techniques.

One who would become an initiate withdraws from ordinary life to seek wisdom in a setting free of distractions, such as a monastery, a remote temple, or the dojo of a famous teacher. In some societies, the philosophy of the elements is widely known and respected as a path all should seek to progress along during the course of their lives. Among other cultures, these teachings are regarded as exotic or are unheard of. No matter the viewpoint of others, the path of the initiate is one of truth seeking and selfknowledge above all, a lifelong search for meaning and understanding.\\n\\tBefore heading into the world, most elemental initiates lead ascetic lives. They own little more than the robes on their backs, and they eschew luxuries and intemperate behavior as distractions from the path to which they devote themselves. An initiate strives to curb passions rather than allowing those passions to rule. An elemental initiate might be a student who preserves ancient tomes, a martial arts disciple who studies the four elements, or an anchorite absorbed in the exploration of the mind in the wild and lonely places of the world. Philosophically minded initiates devote hours each day to study, discourse, and observation of the world around them, while others dedicate their time to meditation and exercise. In and around the daily discipline of the monastery or temple, common chores and tasks are shared among all members of the order.\\n\\tTypical elemental initiates are content to remain in their hidden temples and remote monasteries all their lives, devoting themselves to the study of their philosophy. However, some believe that they must travel widely, to pass on their learning and to absorb new lessons from the world outside the monastery walls. Other initiates take up a life of humble service, using their unusual training and abilities to help others. Adventuring elemental initiates come from the latter two camps.\\nCreating: Many kinds of characters might begin their training in monasteries, dojos, or isolated temples. Monks and battleminds are especially likely to do so. Characters as diverse as assassins, swordmages, and wizards can also flourish in cloistered environments where a student can focus on mastering a rare and difficult art. Some races and cultures, such as the githzerai, possess strong monastic traditions and make a point of training their most promising youths in secluded environments. Githzerai society is almost entirely organized around monasteries devoted to elemental study and in the Elemental Chaos.

They are, after all, the most dominant forms, and most elemental creatures incorporate one or two of these fundamental elements into their being. Less prominent elemental provinces include all manner of phenomena from magma to ice, and smoke to metal. Although devotees of these lesser forces might be rarer than others, they are no less capable than other users of elemental magic. The ironwroughts prove this fact time and time again.\\n\\tThe first ironwroughts appeared not long after human empires extended into the Elemental Chaos. Faced with teeming demons, mad slaads, and hostile elementals, as well as physical changes the settlers experienced after being exposed to the plane, the best warriors filled their time perfecting fighting techniques. The heavy armor, the metal weaponry, and their iron resolve all inclined them toward the lesser-known province of elemental metal. It took no time for these warriors to adopt metallic characteristics, becoming less human and more like the creatures they were sworn to fight. Calling themselves the ironwrought, they proved instrumental in throwing back the elemental hordes long enough for their people to establish colonies.\\n\\tFrom these early warriors descend the ironwrought societies still found across the Elemental Chaos and in the natural world. Two of these, the Scions of Steel and the Iron Brotherhood, actively recruit novices to train in the mystic arts. These warriors hire themselves out as mercenaries across the planes, selling their swords to whoever can afford the fee. Their reputation for excellence keeps these battle groups in constant employ, and they can be found fighting for the efreets, guarding caravans, standing watch on the walls of githzerai fortresses, and elsewhere on the plane and beyond.\\nCreating: Ironwrought adventurers come from the ranks of warriors, especially those who favor heavy armor and military weapons. Combat training establishes the proper mind-set for gaining and using elemental metal's power. Fighters, some paladins, and battleminds have the needed talents to merge elemental magic with their particular fighting art. Ironwroughts make strong battle leaders, and some of the greatest examples come from the ranks of warlords, runepriests, and ardents.\\n\\tYou might have stumbled onto your heritage by some stroke of fate (good or bad). Maybe you learned to use elemental metal by joining an ironwrought society that shepherded you into your new nature through a mystical ceremony, altering your course forever. Then again, you could be a native of the Elemental Chaos who acquired your talents naturally from the wild plane.\\n\\tAlthough the ironwroughts originated in humanity, any humanoid who has the discipline and fighting skill can join ironwrought ranks. Ironwrought masters accept students who demonstrate physical prowess, toughness, and speed.

Few mortals realize, however, that being the slave of a genie is far from an unpleasant existence. These servants lead lives not much different from those of the common workers, servants, soldiers, and artisans found toiling in and around the castles and palaces of nobles in the world. Even the most ordinary genie-whether dao, djinn, efreet, or marid-fancies itself a great lord with a high and royal title. It regards the everyday business of administering its estates and overseeing its property to be a task utterly beneath its attention. Instead, these genie overlords leave most of their affairs in the hands of a select caste of trusted, loyal slaves known as janissaries.\\n\\tSome janissaries are part of a genie's household staff and have little freedom to travel, but most large genie cities and realms are host to a whole class of janissaries who are considered slaves of the throne, rather than of a particular genie. Most such janissaries serve as elite soldiers, city officials, or highly valued artisans and engineers. They are allowed to own property, bear arms, travel, marry, and engage in whatever pursuits they like, although most are guards or bureaucrats in the ruler's service. Adventuring janissaries usually come from this group and are free to do as they please-until a high-ranking genie commands a service from them. It's not unusual for janissaries to venture into the mortal world on various errands, then stay on to seek their fortunes when their original mission is completed.\\n\\tAlthough janissaries are often rich, comfortable, and entrusted with great authority, they are still subject to the whims of their genie masters. Goodnatured genies, such as djinns and marids, treat their janissaries well and bestow honors and offices on servants who show cleverness, reliability, and efficiency. Daos and efreets, on the other hand, are cruel and overbearing, so they naturally value servants who use brutality and viciousness when attending to their duties. In most realms janissaries enjoy at least some legal protection against poor or capricious treatment, but in return they are expected to police themselves stringently and to comply with any order or request a genie gives them.\\nCreating: A janissary might come to hold many different offices and perform a number of duties, but an adventuring janissary is, first and foremost, a warrior who helps make up the core of a genie's entourage or army.

Such a master can use water to touch other minds, ease suffering, and alter one's appearance to stave off age or conceal one's physical connection to the Elemental Chaos.\\n\\tOf all the expressions of elemental power in the world, the art of watershaping was not an accidental discovery. Most who know of it see it as a blessing from the kindly primordial Ben-hadar to ease the suffering created by the Dawn War. Some skeptics suggest that the \\\"gift\\\" was nothing more than a way to help the primordials maintain a foothold in the natural world. Regardless of the motive behind its existence, watershaping has helped mortals travel around the world by enabling them to brave the ocean's surface and explore its depths. All waterfaring people count themselves lucky if they have a watershaper in their midst.\\n\\tWatershapers operate as advisors, envoys, and arbitrators in the communities they live in or near. They keep the peace, urging calm in their fellows. As reasonable and diplomatic as watershapers can be, they have a stormy side. When one is roused to violence, he or she can be a dangerous adversary.\\nCreating: Halflings, not surprisingly given their association with rivers and lakes, produce more watershapers than any other race. But the riverfolk do not share  their secrets with other peoples, and an outsider must find some other way to learn watershaping. A primordial shard, especially one found at the bottom of a still pond or lodged in the rocks below a waterfall, might offer its possessor a relatively easy way to become a watershaper.\\n\\tAside from halflings, humans and elves are next most likely to learn this craft. As great explorers, humans brave the seas, searching for new lands and peoples. Elves honor the wilderness and might discover the power of elemental water in a sacred stream or a pool in a remote part of a forest.\\n\\tAnyone with an interest in commanding the waves-even someone who has no previous life in or on the water-can nurture that interest and develop into a watershaper. Although any watershaper can become a warrior, and many are vaunted combatants, others find the talents they have cultivated are best used to aid the injured and bolster companions, contributing toward completing a shared quest in ways other than swinging a sword. Watershapers who adopt this lifestyle are almost always bards, since they can help their comrades and learn spells that take advantage of their water manifestations.

Some claim that they still watch over the eladrin cities today, always circling, always vigilant until the day when they are vitally needed.\\n\\tOther accounts hypothesize that the djinn handed down the secrets of becoming a windlord to mortal allies who had earned their trust. Support for this claim is found in frescoes in the ruined city of Badalada, perched atop a f loating earthmote in the Elemental Chaos, that show djinn carrying what are obviously humans, elves, and other races through the air and teaching them to f ly. If there were such connections between these races, they are long dead now, since the djinn presently show little interest in forging bonds with the people of the natural world.\\n\\tA windlord who strikes out in the world does not go long without attracting a potential employer. One who does not pursue the life of an adventurer might find work as a spy or a scout. Being able to manipulate elemental air helps such an individual pick out sounds another person might not perceive. A windlord can hide on a high perch and monitor enemy movements, or find a path through the wilderness from the advantage of an aerial position.\\nCreating: Best known for their speed and mobility, windlords are agile combatants, darting through the air and supplementing their attacks with gusts that rush in from nowhere. Many windlords use hit-and-run tactics, similar to those that might be employed by monks, rangers, and assassins. Although elemental air does not increase an attack's potency, it does help a combatant get into a superior position from where he or she can attack.\\n\\tMages, psions, druids, and others can use power over elemental air to make up for any shortcoming they might have in weapon use. With the increased maneuverability and defensive properties elemental air can provide, such implement wielders can better reach places where they can use their magic to the greatest effect.\"},{\"@name\":\"Windlord Starting Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4320\",\"@source\":\"Heroes of the Elemental Chaos\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"You must embrace the untamed nature of the Elemental Chaos to wield its power.

The feuds, alliances, and enmities of the city require a special class of citizen to navigate: the brazen ambassadors.\\n\\tDeveloped as a means for embattled efreets to communicate with their peers, brazen ambassadors have taken on a greater role, not just within the City of Brass but also on far-flung planes. Today, brazen ambassadors handle most of a lord's affairs, from negotiating alliances with the city's many courts to brokering with planar traders that come to the city. They even deign to represent Bashamgurda, Lord of the Efreets, and through him, the City of Brass itself.\\n\\tEach brazen ambassador is drawn from the ranks of slaves within the City of Brass, and the decision to elevate such an individual is not made lightly. The process requires potent magic, demanding the investment of an efreet patron's power. The efreet first draws off some of its burning blood, which a specially trained ritual practitioner, or sahaar, uses to tattoo arcane symbols on the skin of the chosen figure. As it cools, the blood leaves a brass filigree etched into the ambassador's skin. This initiation is dangerous; the frail do not survive. Adventurers are prized choices to become brazen ambassadors because they are far more likely to survive the process than any common slaveling.\\n\\tThe markings on an ambassador serve two purposes. The first and most obvious is to distinguish a brazen ambassador as more than a mere slave. At a glance, an efreet can know that the words of such an individual are not the mere whining of a lowly slave- they are treated as the words of a peer. Second, the ritual causes the blood of the patron to intermingle with that of its ambassador, causing the ambassador to become a part of that efreet's bloodline. The connection between an ambassador and its patron is a potent one, permitting the efreet to invest an ambassador with some of its power, even across the planes.\\nCreating: A brazen ambassador must speak with unshakable confidence and quick wit; stories claim that such envoys are able to cause kings to doubt themselves. As the mouthpieces of their lords, ambassadors are expected to emulate the arrogance and certainty of the efreets. Bards and warlords are sought out for this ability, though anyone capable of constructing an entertaining enough lie could catch the attention of an efreet lord. Sometimes negotiations in the City of Brass are conducted at the tip of a sword, though, so it is also possible for members of martial classes to slip into the ranks of the brazen ambassadors. Of those, quick-witted rogues excel, since they can operate as assassins when demands go unmet and negotiations fail. Brazen ambassadors who use divine power are almost unheard of: Efreets are jealous creatures, and demand their servants follow no other master.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Brazen Ambassador Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4435\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 408\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"Cutting your diplomatic teeth within the courts of the efreets is a dangerous prospect.

The cult is a fragmented organization. Few members fully understand the forces they worship, but all have a common goal: to blur the lines between the mortal world and the Elemental Chaos. The various sects have different understandings of what will happen when they achieve that goal, but they all pursue it with equal fervor.\\n\\tOne of the more unusual methods used by the cults to hasten the planar merging is the creation of the creatures known as chaosmade. Strange hybrids of mortal races and the Elemental Chaos itself, the chaosmade are living, breathing hosts of the disquieting forces of the plane. Wherever chaosmade walk, order is doomed to fall into disorder, and, little by little, the Elemental Chaos leaks into the world.\\n\\tThe creation of a chaosmade is an exercise in potent magic, done in secret. The cult continually watches the offspring of its members to see if any bear the marks of chaos. These marks manifest in many ways, from an unusual birthmark, to a hatred for tradition, to an unrestrained spirit. These criteria change from one cult to another, but the outcome is the same. The cult takes the child to its inner sanctum, where it is reborn as a chaosmade.\\n\\tThe high priest strips a portion of the child's soul away and plants in its place a seed of pure chaos, which in time will grow and flourish. This force feeds on the whims and urges of the individual, and in turn, it shapes those urges toward fomenting discord. In return, a chaosmade has access to immense power that, while it can be directed, is torturously difficult to control.\\nCreating: Wisely considered dangerous, a chaosmade is able to infuse any plane with the disquieting forces of disorder, calling upon the raw energy that rages within. Chaosmade who expose themselves to this energy face the risk of burning out from the power within their soul. Eventually, most will learn to restrain themselves, but some choose to let the chaos run wild, believing that it is their place to unfix the stagnant bonds of order wherever they find it.\\n\\t\\tChaosmade can pursue nearly any career, but many choose to enter professions that allow them to indulge in their chaotic nature. The lure of the arcane is seductive to a chaosmade, and many work as mages. Others feed the call for pandemonium with wanton destruction as barbarians or ferocious rogues. A rare few, though, attempt to quell the chaos within, seeking some fragment of order in their otherwise disordered lives by enrolling in organizations with strong structure and rules they can build their lives around. These chaosmade make potent fighters and warlords. The path of leadership is particularly seductive to young chaosmade. Within their cults, they were destined for positions of leadership, either as the heads of a cultist cells, or ordained as generals meant to lead armies of the faithful against the world.\\n\\t\\tIt is rare to find sorcerers, particularly those who wield wild magic, within the ranks of the chaosmade. The seed of chaos within a chaosmade's soul jealously consumes any other source of power, and any attempt to draw more fully on the Elemental Chaos is to invite disaster. A mortal form simply cannot withstand so much of the plane's raw energy, and the unlucky few who attempt to do so are twisted into horrifying creatures, shifting from one agonizing form to the next with each breath.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Chaosmade Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4438\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 408\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"Your altered nature becomes evident as the chaos within begins to change you.

Stormraiders are a specialized class of pirates who strike the trade lanes of the Elemental Chaos aboard their fast lightning skiffs.\\n\\tKnown for the suddenness and ferocity of their attacks, stormraiders lack any formalized structure. Instead, they have a loose fraternity built around a few common guidelines: \\\"Help a raider crew in need,\\\" \\\"Share in the plunder,\\\" and \\\"Never betray a comrade before the mast\\\" serve as the only laws of stormraider society. Petty disputes are resolved in bloody duels on the deck of a lightning skiff, usually surrounded by a cheering crew betting on the outcome. It is a hard and uncertain life, knowing no home but one's ship, with no safe port of call. Death can come quickly at the end of a sword, or slowly at the talons of a demon that is tired of losing its treasures to stormraider crews. The only havens known to stormraider ships are a few small pirate ports built on twirling earthmotes, where lighting skiffs can rest their crews, resupply, and repair their vessels. Still, many are willing to fight beneath the thunderhead-black flag of piracy. Escaped slaves from the City of Brass revel in the freedom they find in the stormraider's life, and pirates from the Riverweb seeking new adventures can readily find it on the deck of a lightning skiff. No matter the background of the individual, the life of a raider is one of constant momentum, quickly transitioning from one adventure to the next.\\n\\tStormraider heroes regularly command the respect of the crews they serve alongside, often seeming to be marked for greatness. Aboard a lightning skiff commanded by a particularly bloodthirsty captain, these heroes are often the sole voice of reason, able to keep the captain from bouts of wanton and pointless slaughter. It is not unheard of for communities in the Elemental Chaos to hire adventuring stormraiders as privateers, or for lords to employ crews to raid the ships of personal enemies. The Elemental Chaos is full of opportunities, and clever stormraiders stand poised to claim them all.\\nCreating: There are many different reasons to become a stormraider. Some do it as a way to escape their past, others out of lust for treasure. So long as a raider can hold his own in raids, he is welcome aboard a lightning skiff. Most raids happen in tight quarters, and members of classes that favor hand-to-hand combat are common. Stormraider crews also use sharpshooters in the rigging to pick out officers or troublesome defenders on enemy ships, so rangers and warlocks are valuable to raider captains.\\n\\t\\tUpon induction to a stormraider crew, all new members receive new names. This is because they are being reborn in a new family, with the captain as father, the ship as mother, and the crew standing in as a family of bloodthirsty brothers and sisters.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Stormraider Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4442\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 408\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"Stormraiders usually find themselves fighting against enemies that are more numerous.

Savage humanoids gather in fell places to launch raids against caravans and homestead alike. Twisted monsters lurk in the shadows and deep caves. Old ruins harbor the spirits of old kings and warriors turned to evil. As dangerous as these realms can be, certain folk take it upon themselves to protect the world and innocents from these threats. From the fearless ranger who prowls the old paths to the druid who secures founts of primal magic from exploitation and ruin, such guardians fight on the front lines against the spreading darkness. Yet they do not fight alone. The legendary werebears emerge from their isolation to fight at their sides and uphold the ancient charge placed upon them by nature's divine protector.\\n\\tWerebears stand apart from most skinchangers. They lack the evil natures that compel their cousins to commit violence against mankind. Rather than grapple with the bloodlust and savagery so pervasive among the werebeasts, they retain their morality, in part from Melora's favor and also from the great task they accept as theirs. As Sehanine's curse spread through the werebeast clans, Melora reached out from her heavenly realm and sheltered the bear clan. They had ever been among her most devout servants and took no part in the misguided effort to steal the moon from the sky. In exchange, she commanded them and all their descendants to protect the world against their fellows' wickedness, to secure the wilderness against the despoiler and destroyer, and, above all, to keep alive the old ways of the world's magic.\\n\\tAlthough many werebears descend from the bear clan, others come by their lycanthropic natures in different ways. Rangers, wardens, and others might receive the gift of lycanthropy after performing a great service for the druids or for a nature spirit. Melora sometimes rewards favored priests with the ability to transform into bears after a demonstration of uncommon devotion.\\n\\tRegardless of the transformation's cause, werebears do not remain in civilized areas. They live alone in unspoiled forests and mountains. They construct crude shelters or settle in caves. And the lands and all the creatures living there for miles around fall under their protection. Werebears tend their lands and watch over their charges to ensure the natural processes are left undisturbed. Should anything or anyone threaten the lands they guard, the werebears respond with deadly force and lead the people and the beasts to destroy their intruder, fighting until no threat remains.\\n\\tEven though many werebears remain in their chosen lands, some do not settle in one place for long. They come to see the entire world as their responsibility. These werebears are the ones most likely to become adventurers, and they crusade against evil in all its forms.

They live in squalor and filth. They eat whatever they can, fouling foodstuffs and other supplies with their leavings. And they breed at an alarming rate. For these reasons, most folk consider rats vermin and it's no surprise that rat catchers patrol almost every city, venturing into the sewers and exploring the docks with dog and club to control the rat population. Whispers circulate among those who do this thankless job about the big rats that can break a ratter's neck with a single bite. And then some tell stories that no one dares believe: tales of rats who walk upright as humans.\\n\\tWererats find no more welcome among other skinchangers than they do in civilization. Deemed the lowest form of werebeast, they have few opportunities to interact with other clans. Instead, they keep to their own kind and live with the rats whose warrens they share. More than any other lycanthrope, wererats live among human populations, hiding in plain sight and learning the secret ways in and out of the city to move about unseen when hunting. They claim the sewers, the abandoned buildings, and the slums, where witnesses are rare and reports about their activities go unheard. They are scavengers, picking through civilization's leavings and spreading their disease wherever they can.\\n\\tDespite the hostility toward wererats coming from all fronts, they not only survive, but also thrive. Wererats might be hated, yet they exist in the largest numbers. They might be rejected, yet they operate in extensive communities so that they do not need assistance or aid from other werebeasts. And although they might lack the ferocity or durability enjoyed by rivals, their swarms can overwhelm even the toughest werewolf.\\n\\tSince wererats live among humans, they have the best opportunities to pursue adventuring classes. Rarely, a wererat might change his or her views regarding humans and make efforts at restitution for past crimes, if not directly to improve the community, then indirectly to fight for other communities.

They and the wolves they enslave are aggressive, vicious, and unrelenting in their attacks. Werewolf packs are dangerous, since they can scout out the landscape by day in human form and launch attacks by night.

The hunger remains, but a strong will can control it. It is always a struggle, though. A werewolf must always fight to keep the beast in check, and sometimes even the best efforts are not enough. Werewolves seeking redemption for or escape from their natures favor the adventurer's life since it carries them away from innocents and lets them vent their fury on more deserving foes.\\n\\tNearly all werewolves inherited their natures from their parents, passing on what many would consider to be a curse.

Those of good heart stand against its machinations and struggle to rebuild in the aftermath of the conflict. For bloodsworn, though, guarding against wickedness is not enough. They take the fight to their enemies in a quest to destroy them all.\\n\\tEvil creates the situation that brings a bloodsworn into existence. Some terrible event sows the seeds of vengeance in an individual's heart, goading him or her to take up sword and staff to fight back against the darkness and ensure that evil never rears its head again. Often, bloodsworn are survivors of slaughters, whether from goblin marauding, a dark cult's sacrifices, or grimlock raids. Swearing bitter vows to the gods or to their dead comrades, bloodsworn travel a path of righteous vengeance.\\nCreating: Bloodsworn exist among all races, classes, and cultures. One tragedy is enough to set an individual on the path of vengeance. When creating a bloodsworn character, consider the following story elements.\\nChoose Your Enemy\\nEvery bloodsworn has an enemy that defines him or her. You can choose any individual, creature, or institution to be your enemy. Think about who your enemy is, what it did, and why it did so.\\n\\tTailor your training to better defeat that hated foe and counter its capabilities, tactics, and motivations. A bloodsworn who drives back orc hordes is very different from one who is committed to wiping out the Cult of the Elder Elemental Eye or one who has sworn to destroy giants. As you make decisions about feats, powers, and other game elements, keep your chosen enemy in mind and pick options to help you bring it down.\\n\\tKeep in mind your foe's level relative to your own. If you are pursuing dark elves, you probably won't encounter them until the heroic tier's upper reaches at the earliest. On the other hand, goblins will cease to be a meaningful challenge once you hit the paragon tier. Be sure to talk with your Dungeon Master to make sure your chosen enemy fits into the campaign's story and level range.\\n\\tYou should also consider the scope of your vengeance. A limited goal makes defeating your chosen foe reasonable and achievable. Do you really want to exterminate all dark elves (an impossible task) or only the drow of House Eilserv?\\n\\tFinally, think about your character's life before the tragedy changed you. What did you want to become? What were your dreams? What did you value? Do you still hope to reclaim the life that was taken from you, or have you given up all such expectations, knowing the road you now walk leads only to death?\\nVengeance's Inspiration\\nYour enemy could inspire the choices you make about your character. Consider deciding on your enemy before you select your class or race to guide you and suggest a character who best reflects your choice of adversary. If you prefer to choose your race and class first, those details in turn might suggest certain enemies.\\n\\tMany races in the Dungeons & Dragons world have natural enemies. The history of the fey folk pits drow against eladrin and elves. Dwarves fought giants and orcs in ancient times. Dragonborn and tieflings have good reason to hate each other. The reasons behind these conflicts could be lost in the past, but the animosity remains very much alive. Choosing an enemy that has strong ties to your race helps reinforce your character's place in the world.\\n\\tJust as race can help determine your chosen foe, your choice of class can suggest certain opponents and bring your character to life. Most classes have no particular animosities, but divine characters often pit themselves against servants of other gods. A priest of Corellon might vow to fight Gruumsh's servants, and the Raven Queen's paladins despise Zehir's priests. A psion or an ardent might venture into the Underdark to seek out a portal to the Far Realm and prevent a flood of monstrosities from reaching the world.\\n\\tAn unexpected choice for your hated enemy can create interesting dynamics in the group. For example, everyone expects a dwarf to hate orcs and giants, but you might create a dwarf fighter who has sworn to defeat an Underdark merchant consortium that exploited your people and emptied their vaults.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Bloodsworn Starting Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4469\",\"@source\":\"Dungeon Survival Handbook\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"The dead haunt your dreams, a constant reminder of your failure to save those closest to you.

Countless tunnels and caverns, rivers and oceans form a fantastic, globe-spanning environment. To the unprepared, though, the underground wilderness is as ruthless as it is wondrous. Those who survive these wilds are among the greatest explorers in the world. For these deep delvers, an expedition to the Underdark is no more threatening than a stroll through the woods.\\n\\tDeep delvers are driven by an unquenchable desire to pit themselves against the challenges of the subterranean world. Some seek to map out the spiraling highway-tunnels of the Underdark. Others are naturally drawn to the seclusion of caves, preferring to abandon life on the surface. Yet others are born to the Underdark and still call it home.\\nCreating: Deep delvers are a diverse lot, united only by their will to thrive in the caverns they call home. Though deep delvers come from all races, few surface dwellers other than humans are likely to choose this path. Many deep delvers come from races native to the Underdark, such as dwarves and svirfneblin, who have a natural affinity for dungeoneering. Classes that specialize in survival  skills, such as druids, rangers, and rogues, also excel as deep delvers. Consider the following story elements when creating a deep delver character.\\nBorn Above\\nIf you belong to a race native to the surface, something uncanny must have inspired you to favor a life below ground-and to enable you to survive there. The Underdark's scope and geography are unlike anything aboveground. Think about why you decided to live below the earth, and thus how you approach its many challenges.\\n\\tAre you constantly in search of new sights and experiences? Is the physical challenge of getting there half the fun? You might revel in the rush of descending a miles-deep chasm or swimming through a flooded cave. The thrill of being the first to see such a sight is its own reward.\\n\\tYou might instead be a deep delver out of necessity. Perhaps you live in a community located near an entrance to the Underdark that must contend with raids by monsters or savage humanoids, so that patrolling the tunnel and the area around it is essential to your home's survival. Alternatively, your livelihood might depend on searching the Underdark for precious resources, such as rare minerals and magical components, or simply for food. In either case you must become a master of underground tracking and observation to succeed.\\n\\tThe most well-known deep delvers have patrons who pay them to explore the Underdark. You might be the employee of a wealthy monarch, hired to map an extensive series of passages discovered in one of the realm's mines. Does your patron plan to open up trade with Underdark civilizations, or hope to use the tunnels to launch secret attacks against rivals? The results of your exploration could trigger far-reaching events in the campaign.\\n\\tConsider also what you're leaving behind  as you delve. Your connection to family and friends on the surface is cut off during your ventures, but maybe that is the point. Did you become a deep delver to escape something? If so, what better place to hide than the limitless depths of the Underdark?\\nBorn Below\\nFor deep delvers who hail from the Underdark, the subterranean realm isn't a mystery- it's home. What topsiders see as a place of legendary dangers, mythic locales, and otherworldly beasts is just what you deal with every day. If your character is a member of an Underdark race, you probably have little patience with the blundering surface dwellers waving torches in your backyard.\\n\\tConsider how your character's home and culture fits into the campaign. Dwarves, renowned for their tremendous underground cities, live in the upper reaches of the realm and regularly deal with surface communities. The same goes for savage humanoids such as goblins or kobolds, though their behavior is far less civil. These races live close enough to the surface that their domains have the feel of a nearby wilderness, much as a human or elf hunter would see a forest or swamp close to home-a place to be taken seriously but lacking mystery.\\n\\tRaces that dwell deeper, such as the svirfneblin, are one with the Underdark, which provides them with shelter and sustenance. Deep delvers of these races see the world above as a place of wonder and legend, and they view explorers from the surface as sightseeing nuisances.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Deep Delver Starting Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4472\",\"@source\":\"Dungeon Survival Handbook\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"For you, a trek to the Underdark is all in a day's work.

These perverse beings-aboleths, mind flayers, and worse-exert a loathsome control over the minds of others. Few who become their slaves ever return. Yet some of dauntless resolve do escape, though they are forever burdened by the scars of their slavery. The lingering voice of the master echoes just beyond comprehension in the backs of their minds.\\nCreating: The aberrant entities that enslave the minds of mortals care little what they prey upon, so escaped thralls can be from any race, class, or culture. Many adopt psionic classes, their liberation having awakened new mental abilities.  When creating an escaped thrall character, you should consider the following story elements.\\nMonstrous Enslavement\\nThe nature of your captor plays a huge part in how you portray your character's theme. The haunted visions, physical marks, and story elements can vary wildly depending on what creature enslaved you. In a way, your former master is the most important part of your background.\\n\\tWhatever the creature that enslaved you, its motives are likely mysterious. The identity of your captor might be a secret that is slowly revealed to you over the course of your dungeon expeditions. Keep in mind that many such monsters are of very high level, so if you want any chance of success, you can't just storm into your captor's lair until you have improved your own capabilities.\\nShattered Body\\nMost thralls bear physical marks of their imprisonment. These might be the lashes made by a drow whip across your back, or scars on your neck from a vampire's bite. These injuries testify to the horrors you endured and might make others feel pangs of pity or revulsion. Do you try to conceal your scars so as not to draw attention to yourself, or do you proudly bear them as proof of your indomitable will?\\n\\tPerhaps instead of physical scars, you wear an air of illness. Your skin hangs loose and sickly from malnourishment during your time underground, or dark bags under your eyes reveal that your torment robs you of sleep. Sometimes the signs of your ordeal are subtle, such as the trembling of your hands.\\nScarred Mind\\nYour psychic enslavement has left its mark on your mind. You gained freedom-but at what cost? Do you fear that your master will come for you, or worse, that you might surrender your sanity and return to be enslaved again? Perhaps you cling to ideals or goals to focus your mind, suppressing the memories through force of will. Either way, others might find you enigmatic or even dangerous.\\n\\tEven if you have recovered well, your mind has been permanently altered by your captivity. Casting off mental domination has awakened psionic talent in you that had lain dormant until the moment of your freedom.

To take on adversaries that have superior strength, cunning, or resources (or all three), you need to remove their advantages. Such an alternative approach is the job of a trapsmith.\\n\\tHumanoids have been building traps since the earliest times, developing techniques to take down big game for food and clothing. According to loremasters, goblin tribes were the first to perfect this kind of hunting. They were able to obtain and store more food than their competition, allowing them to survive harsh winters and increase their numbers. Many years later, other races came to appreciate the ingenuity of their counterparts-mainly through direct interaction with goblin traps.\\nCreating: Trapsmiths prefer to live in solitude, honing their skills and mastering their trade. You spend your free time researching new and exciting places to go. You might have a core group of friends, but beyond that, you are not very social. Ironically, you might feel like a prisoner in life-with death the ultimate trap to be defeated.\\n\\tYou might become a trapsmith if you enjoy creating dastardly devices to hinder and harm foes; rogues and possibly rangers are typical classes. You might also choose this theme if you like to play clever tricks or conduct intricate research. A mage or bard makes a good trapsmith. Members of any race might take up such a career, but those with an aptitude for mechanical constructions (such as dwarves, gnomes, or svirfneblin) find greater success, as well as those with some magical aptitude. When creating a trapsmith character, consider the following story elements.\\nAnalytical Mind\\nYou understand physics innately and see life's challenges as equations to be solved, using strict logic to determine the likely success or failure of a course of action. You might not be conscious of this thought process; even in social situations, you tend to analyze the situation coldly instead of considering body language and emotion. Thus, others might think you odd. You prefer to live in solitude, honing your skills and mastering your trade, and you spend your free time researching new and exciting places to go. You might have a core group of friends, but beyond that, you are not very social.\\nAdrenaline Rush\\nNothing is more exciting than disarming a trap that could splatter you across the room. You love getting into the face of death and kicking it hard. You also enjoy the accolades for overcoming dangerous challenges and might purposely seek out bigger and more hazardous traps. The knowledge you win when you survive such dangers lets you make your own creations that much more fiendish.

They take on great risk and danger to dig up great riches. Treasure hunters also enjoy the thrill of the chase when seeking out valuable finds, sometimes to the point of addiction, and this adventurous spirit can be contagious.\\n\\tFinding lost or buried treasure is much harder than it appears at first. Treasure hunters constantly crave more wealth. They generally learn just enough to find their quarry and care nothing for confirming legends or ancient texts-other than to plunder whatever they refer to. Some, though, learn to love the unique history of the antiquities they seek. Those without a formal education might study a subject related to their quest on their own, even becoming specialists on specific topics.\\n\\tTreasure hunters are typically self-sufficient. Occasionally several work together to meet similar goals, but they do not trust each other. Each views the others as brigands and mercenaries out to steal their finds.\\nCreating: You can apply the treasure hunter theme to any character concept that thrives on risk-taking and exploration (even more so than the average adventurer). You might enjoy this theme if you wish to play a cunning character who enjoys overcoming difficult challenges through unconventional thinking. When creating your treasure hunter character, keep these story elements in mind.\\nAdroit Dungeoneer\\nYou are a skilled adventurer, able to adapt to any situation. Although your yearning for wealth and recognition drives you, you have earned a reputation for cleverness. You enjoy finding solutions to problems and applying your unique logic when dealing with unusual situations.\\n\\tThroughout your career as a treasure hunter, you have had to deal with threats that are common in dungeons. Although each dungeon is unique, all share some features. You know these by heart and know how to handle each of them.\\n\\tYour reputation speaks volumes about your sense of adventure and your proven experience. Employers love your attitude and are confident in your success at acquiring an relic or treasure.\\nRecognized Expert\\nMany of the world's famous treasure hunters are renowned for their expertise in recovering specific types of treasure and overcoming the threats that guard them from plunderers. You make sure to be as informed as possible about the places where you will be adventuring.\\n\\tAnother reason to specialize is simply a matter of business. Your choice is based on a given treasure's value, availability, and salability. You might be inclined to let the small fish fight over the latest fad while you bring back more lucrative pieces. On the other hand, you might join the crowd, knowing you are much more likely than the rest to get the goods.\\nLiving on the Edge\\nYou are a thrill-seeker, constantly on the lookout for adventures that will sate your hunger for danger. Riches and fame aren't enough-you love living by the seat of your pants. You feel most alive whenever you get into a precarious situation and manage to avert the danger, all while showing off your skills.\\n\\tNot many can boast of a life as exciting as what you have experienced, and you have no intention of slowing down now. To you, life is a one big treasure hunt, and the ultimate prize is a sense of accomplishment mixed with plenty of thrills. You will look back when you are old and say to yourself, “Whoa!

The cities and enclaves that dot its murky caverns are hotbeds of spite and political intrigue. To survive for long in such societies, you have to know how to play the game. Physical prowess is no match for the wits of a skilled diplomat.\\n\\tThe great city-states of the Underdark were first established as collections of tribes with a shared need for survival. As the centuries rolled by, these settlements developed into self-sufficient communities and grew into nations. Their growth was aided by individuals who could seek out and interact with the other city-states to establish lines of communication. These representatives grew experienced at dealing with the different Underdark races and became expert diplomats and negotiators.\\nCreating: You might become an Underdark envoy if you delight in political intrigue, spying, and social maneuvering. Many successful political leaders were once envoys, whether due to merit and ability, or because they were able to orchestrate the removal of their predecessors.\\n\\tBards and rogues are natural class choices for this career path, as well as any character who has diplomatic talent, including clerics and warlords. Beings of a gruff or  introverted nature, such as dwarves, rarely become envoys. The drow have mastered the skill of diplomacy over centuries of cutthroat politics, and they have the most capable and dominant envoys in the Underdark. Consider the following story elements when creating your Underdark envoy character.\\nDark Delegate\\nYou are an extension of your master's will, an instrument to further his or her interests. On returning from a mission, you are expected to relay not only the response of the other party, but also its tone and attitude. The more information you convey to your employer, the greater advantage he or she will enjoy in political power plays and future exchanges. If you are a freelance envoy, not bound to one employer, you seek to make a name for yourself as a neutral third party. In this capacity you manage labor disputes, conduct trade negotiations, and perform similar tasks, commanding a high wage for your services.\\n\\tYours is a precarious path. You not only deliver communications from your masters, but you also glean whatever information you can while on the job. Anything might give you a crucial advantage in future employment. Thus, you have to be very clever and perceptive, while at the same time appearing inoffensive. This sort of agent works against expectations and can include dwarves, duergar, or svirfneblin.\\nDouble Agent\\nA few Underdark envoys serve as double agents for a faction, generally to facilitate the collapse of a powerful political entity. Such people are rare, for the role is exceedingly dangerous, If you became a double agent, you likely received an offer to betray an employer after delivering a message on his or her behalf-along with a suitable financial incentive to secure such services.\\n\\tAs a double agent, you remain under cover much of the time while you work on behalf of another entity. You maintain your status within your ostensible employer's organization while feeding vital information to the other side, revealing yourself only if your activities are found out. In this role, you must be extremely skilled in both providing misinformation to your target and locating other agents who might have infiltrated the organization. You carefully collect information on everything that has been said and done to support your complex web of political scheming. Should you fail, you're likely to end up dead in some dark alleyway or Underdark corridor. Why do you take such risks? Was your choice personal, to take revenge on a cruel master, or did you do it just for the money?\\nMercantile Advantage\\nNot all Underdark envoys are spies or political plotters. You might use your skills to expand your own wealth and that of others by negotiating merchant treaties between powerful cities. Influential members of Underdark communities employ individuals such as yourself to help increase their economic power while protecting their political interests. Sometimes you manipulate markets to help your employer gain a monetary advantage over rivals.\\n\\tEnvoys of this sort can come from any Underdark race, and they might even include topsiders who are trusted in their dealings with those below. You could be a former explorer who decided to turn your talents to more profitable interests while still keeping your hand in the adventuring business.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Underdark Envoy Starting Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4484\",\"@source\":\"Dungeon Survival Handbook\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"An Underdark envoy is first and foremost a master of manipulation.

He bears marks of shame-scars from lashes and manacles, bruises, brands. Behind lies his home, from which he has been exiled forever. A pained look crosses his face before it is replaced by a determined grimace. The Underdark is not kind to the weak.\\n\\tUnderdark outcasts did not start out as subterranean vagabonds. Some were proud members of their underground society, exemplars of their race's customs or beliefs. They might have been dwarf artisans in the service of a king, or tribal warriors amid chanting goblin hordes. Something happened to disrupt their existence and drive them from their communities. Perhaps they committed a crime or dishonored the family name, or became disgusted by their people's ways. Whatever the reason, they have been cast into the depths to live or die as fate wills.\\n\\tUnderdark outcasts wander far from the place of their disgrace in search of a new life. Usually hated by members of their own society, they must rely on their own wits or the kindness of strangers to survive. Most remain underground out of habit, it being their birthplace, but others deliberately venture to surface realms-though they rarely find refuge there.\\nCreating: Underdark outcasts come from races dwelling underground, such as dwarves, goblins, or svirfneblin. Many belong to folk who get a hostile reception from surface dwellers. They might be of any class or alignment, united only in their common disgrace. Your unique background inspires your personality, class, feat, and power selection. When creating an\\nUnderdark outcast, consider the following story elements.\\nDisgraced Exile\\nBehind every Underdark outcast is a story, though it never ends well. You are defined by the circumstances that led to your banishment. The nature of your transgression varies wildly depending on your race and culture. Dwarves, with their emphasis on duty to the clan and personal honor, expel those who fail to live up to their responsibilities-a traumatic experience for any dwarf. Monstrous races, such as kobolds or orcs, are more likely to cast out one of their own because of a petty or violent disagreement, with the outcast the loser. The nature of your disgrace affects the way you interact with others in a group, especially if members of your race are among them.\\n\\tWhat were the events of your exile? Were you a petty criminal, punished for your crimes? Did you break a dire social taboo, robbing you not only of home but of your dignity as well? Perhaps you betrayed someone important or failed to honor an agreement. Whatever your crime, why were you exiled rather than punished some other way?\\n\\tThe consequences of your banishment matter as well. Maybe you had to leave behind a promising life or something of importance, such as an estate or family. Consider also how your exile has changed you. Are you filled with bitterness and hate, plotting revenge against those who hurt you? Did you go as far away as possible and never look back? Maybe you were falsely judged or made a mistake you regret. Your circumstances might motivate you to undertake a quest to clear your name or undo a wrong.\\nOutcast by Choice\\nSome Underdark outcasts leave their homes willingly. Such a choice is most common among evil Underdark societies, such as those of drow or kobolds. Once in a great while, circumstances can force one of their number to rise above the rest. Striking out into the deep caverns alone took uncommon courage, but you were driven by your convictions.\\n\\tAs a youngster, did you realize that there was something different about you? Perhaps your peers fought and cursed at each other while you were busy thinking. You might have been something of a social revolutionary, trying to drag your incorrigible folk out of their petty ways. How were your efforts viewed by your kind? Did some of these ideas start to catch on, challenging your chief 's rule? You might have had no choice but to ostracize yourself; perhaps you are being hunted through the tunnels around your home.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 Underdark Outcast Starting Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4487\",\"@source\":\"Dungeon Survival Handbook\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"You can never go back.

Though they hail from many races and walks of life, mariners have one thing that unites them-a love of the sea and the freedom it brings. Mariners set their course for wherever the winds take them, whether dodging icebergs in the arctic circle, clipping through the azure waters of the tropics, or crossing vast seas to unknown lands. The crisp sea air is the siren that turns the mariner's rudder to dry land, drawing him or her to see what's beyond the watery horizons.\\n\\tNo two mariners share the same story. Their backgrounds converge only in the fact that they have made a life for themselves aboard a ship. For most, this will have been a decision made by choice. Many find ample opportunities to seek wealth by traveling from port to port to trade goods from distant nations. Experienced mariners sometimes seek rich patrons willing to finance daring voyages. Plotting courses to new lands-and claiming them in the name of their patron-can bring wealth and fame to the mariner. Others might have dedicated their lives to the royal navy, waging war against the realm's enemies by sea. These naval captains are the stuff of legends. Few mariners reach such lofty status, yet even the rank-and-file who crew the ships are rewarded with more adventure and gold than they would ever gain while on land.\\n\\tAlthough many raise sail for love of adventure or as a profession, those who spend most of their lives on ships have darker experiences. These folk are the dread pirates who plunder the coasts. For these individuals, the sea might serve as a refuge from the hangman's noose, but most pirates adopt their ways after realizing that the expansive holds of merchant fleets contain enough wealth for a hundred lifetimes. Fighting, drinking, and the feel of gold spilling through fingers are pleasures enough to draw even honest mariners to live the pirate's life.\\n\\tThe importance that great bodies of water play in various cultures means that members of many races become mariners. Though the great fleets of humanity can dominate the trade lanes, flotillas of halfling skiffs ride the rivers far inland. The graceful prows of eladrin ships glide through the shimmering waters of the Feywild. Underground, dwarven barges cruise through subterranean rivers. Still other mariners are independent members of a tribe, paddling swift canoes or catamarans from island to island.\\n\\tWhether one is a humble sailor, a dashing captain, or a cutthroat pirate, all mariners share a love of freedom. Riding the winds gives them independence unknown by the masses on dry land. The open sea, fleet winds, the song of gulls, and the promise of adventure pull mariners more strongly than the ebbing tide.\\nCreating:\\nMembers of any class could enjoy a life as a mariner. Rogues and rangers excel as mariners due to their diverse skills and maneuverability. Fighters, paladins, and warlords might be mariners aboard a vessel, where they adapt their fighting styles to the close quarters of ship-to-ship warfare. Scholarly characters can draw on their studies to help navigate treacherous waters or communicate with newly encountered civilizations, while ritual-using mariners could conjure winds or sea creatures. Primal characters are sometimes drawn by water spirits to the ocean. Regardless of class, mariners develop similar talents learned from a life at sea, which makes them versatile and responsive to the changing winds of fate.\"},{\"@name\":\"Level 1 The Mariner Starting Feature\",\"@type\":\"Class Feature\",\"@internal-id\":\"ID_TIV_CLASS_FEATURE_DRAGON_412-1\",\"@source\":\"Dragon Magazine 412\",\"Category\":{\"$\":\"1\"},\"Flavor\":{\"$\":\"Crewing a sailing ship requires a host of skills most landlubbers never concern themselves with.

Those who do might become lords of the slime-covered caverns of the Underdark, and command oozes, jellies, puddings, and other aberrations to do their bidding. An ooze master regularly forsakes the comforts of traditional drow society to venture into the cold, wet, dark, and abandoned places of the earth. There, an acolyte of That Which Lurks can study the slimes of the Underdark, with only Ghaunadaur's insane whispers to keep him or her company. When an ooze master walks the halls of drow cities and settlements, he or she strives to keep a low profile, because strange mannerisms and a fascination with aberrant creatures serve only to draw unwanted attention.\\n\\tAn ooze master must fight constantly against whispers of madness that seek to consume the mind. Ghaunadaur desires only to devour the world, and Ghaunadaur's worshipers claim to hear his voice inside their heads, urging them down a path of destruction. With arcane power gifted by the ancient god, an ooze master calls forth corrosive goo to scar and maim opponents. An adherent that is lucky enough to retain some semblance of sanity normally exhibits only a few symptoms of Ghaunadaur's madness, but an episode of full-blown insanity can still strike at a moment's notice.\\n\\tWorship of Ghaunadaur is forbidden in Menzoberranzan. Even the maddest of acolytes knows better than to invoke foul magic in the presence of Lolth's servants. Traveling with an ooze master is dangerous; many of the Spider Queen's agents have been trained to recognize the telltale signs of insanity.\\n\\nCreating:\\nMost ooze masters are wizards, psions, invokers, clerics, or others who have a bookish nature, a strong mind, and a penchant for magical study.

These apostate drow have renounced the teachings of Lolth and embraced a philosophy based on individuality and free will. Existence for these secret apostates is dangerous, because they live in constant fear of discovery by Lolth's many spies. If their true nature is discovered, they face certain torture and death.\\n\\tA secret apostate values freedom and choice, and each pursues personal goals independent of those dictated by other members of drow society or its dark mistress. By no stretch of the imagination does this imply most secret apostates are noble or good; they remain just as selfish and avaricious as other drow. They believe that their aspirations and desires trump those of an overbearing and controlling theocracy.\\n\\tAfter renouncing Lolth, a secret apostate usually travels one of two paths. Some develop such a strong hatred for their own society that they actively work to undermine and destroy it. Specializing in elaborate schemes and intrigues, such an apostate might foment a slave rebellion or create conflict between two houses by assassinating a high-ranking official of one house and framing the other for the deed.\\n\\tOther secret apostates become loners, seeking to avoid others of their kind and to forge their own destinies.

Primarily spies, assassins, and thieves, adherents of Vhaeraun slip stealthily through the shadows of the city on missions for the Masked God of Night. Open worship of Vhaeraun is forbidden, so his followers must conceal their allegiance. Many cannot endure the constant fear of capture and flee to the surface world.\\n\\tAlmost all skulkers of Vhaeraun are disenfranchised male drow who are disappointed by their lack of authority and power in Menzoberranzan's matriarchal society. Although some have renounced the evil ways of their people, many Vhaeraun worshipers remain true to drow nature, and they readily lie, steal, and betray if it serves their needs.\\n\\tA skulker of Vhaeraun excels at getting into and out of hostile areas unnoticed. Consider an assassin who infiltrates a noble manse to slay its occupants with poisonous blades. Imagine a thief slipping into a temple of Lolth to steal a priceless treasure or cutting a dangling purse from an easy mark in a city street. Picture an accomplished spy, who might pose as a consort to a loyal priestess to glean information from her, or who might accept employ in a rival house's guard to overhear secrets. Each of these individuals might worship the Masked Lord.\\n\\tPoison is the favored weapon of Vhaeraun's servants. A skulker excels in its use, coating his blades and arrows with drow sleep poison or other exotic poisons such as black lotus extract or spotted toadstool venom. The Masked Lord's followers delight in discovering new poisons and pay handsomely to acquire them.\\n\\nCreating:\\nMost of Vhaeraun's faithful are surface-dwelling drow. Many skulkers are rogues and assassins, although bards and warlocks might also serve as spies for the Masked God of Night. Divine practitioners are also common.
