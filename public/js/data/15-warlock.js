The dark energy you wield is inherently harmful to the mortal body, and only through sheer physical resolve and discipline can you wield it safely. Fey pact spells rely on Charisma. Your force of will and your ability to bargain with the fey is key to spells of this type. Star pact spells require you to be physically inured to the rigors of otherworldly energy (Constitution), and also ambitious and driven enough to impose your willpower on the strands of fate (Charisma)."},{"@name":"Power Name","$":"Spells"},{"@name":"_RoleElement","$":"ID_FMP_ROLE_3"},{"@name":"_PowerSourceElement","$":"ID_FMP_POWER_SOURCE_2"},{"@name":"_SecondaryPowerSourceElement"},{"@name":"Secondary Abilities"},{"@name":"Hybrid Talent Options"},{"@name":"Short Description","$":"You draw on a pact formed with a greater power, using that alliance to vex your enemies."},{"@name":"_ParentClass"},{"@name":"Trait Package"}],"rules":{"grant":{"@name":"ID_INTERNAL_GRANTS_WARLOCK","@type":"Grants"},"textstring":{"@name":"_CLASSNAME","@value":"ID_FMP_CLASS_7"},"statadd":[{"@name":"_LEVEL-ONE-HPS","@value":"+12"},{"@name":"_PER-LEVEL-HPS","@value":"+5"},{"@name":"Healing Surges","@value":"+6"},{"@name":"Reflex Defense Class Bonus","@value":"+1"},{"@name":"Will Defense Class Bonus","@value":"+1"}],"select":[{"@type":"Build","@number":"1","@Category":"$$CLASS","@optional":"true"},{"@type":"Skill Training","@number":"4","@Category":"ID_FMP_CLASS_7"}]},"$":"Warlocks channel arcane might wrested from primeval entities.

is not entirely known. Some believe that the powerful tiefling warlock who created the first infernal pact created the blade. Others believe that it is the remains of an ancient curse placed upon Asmodeus, lord of the Nine Hells, for his treachery in slaying the god remembered as He Who Was and rising to rule all devilkind. What is known is that although infernal pact hexblades are hated and loathed by devils, those hexblades bearing a blade of annihilation are met with even greater wrath. This might be due to the fact that some believe the blade is crafted from the essence of slain devils, and that their life force is what powers a hexblades pact.\n     There might be some truth to the thought that the blade is a partially sentient being, for it seems to exult whenever it is used to defeat an enemy. With soul eater, you unlock the weapon's ability to drain a foe's life essence to empower your attacks. Blazing doom of the void stokes the weapon's bloodlust, causing flames to lick along its edge as it slices into your enemy. A hexblade wielding this weapon hears a faint roar in his or her mind with each strike, as if some faint, distant being seeks greater acts of bloodlust.

What little the common folk understand about wizards revolves around their scholarly pursuits. Warlocks, however, know about different paths to power. The labyrinthine rules and theories of arcane magic are by no means complete. In some places, the laws of magic are vague, twisted, or subject to the whims of powerful entities. Warlocks enter into pacts with these entities, pledging their service and their souls in return for access to spells. With a word of promise, warlocks gain great power, but rarely do they have the wisdom and foresight needed to wield such power.\n     A warlock gains this power with little practice or focus. One need only learn the rituals needed to contact a planar entity in order to gain a warlock's power. Most warlocks face suspicion and mistrust from the common people, because all too often those who embrace this path do so in search of a quick, easy way to gain power over others. Yet for every warlock who enters a pact for selfish reasons, there is one who turned to it as a last resort against a mad tyrant or a rampaging horde of monsters.\n     Warlocks rarely congregate in large groups. They easily accept members of other classes as allies, but there are few if any guilds, schools, or other organizations to bind them. The typical warlock enters into a pact and perfects its magic alone. Aside from the rituals used to create pacts, little formal research or study is involved in the warlock's art.\n     Hexblades are warlocks who learn to shape the arcane energy of their pacts into deadly weapons, such as a sword forged from infernal power or a slender blade that gleams with fey magic. Both a warrior and an arcanist, a hexblade uses a deadly combination of spells and fighting ability during combat.\t\n     Few people trust hexblades. Although most common folk are at best suspicious of wizards, the typical mage isolates himself or herself while engaging in arcane study, rarely exposing the populace to deadly magic. Hexblades come by their power through an easier, and more easily mistrusted, path. Some of the greatest villains to plague the land have been hexblades. After stumbling across the rituals and incantations needed to contact and forge a bargain with a mighty entity, a marauding bandit or a bloodthirsty ore chieftain could become a hexblade. The entities that would grant power to hexblades care little for how such a gift is used. Their interest is focused on the souls and the powder provided to them by those to whom they give power through a pact. And such evil hexblades don't isolate themselves in the wild, but instead take what they want from those less powerful.\t\n     Those few hexblades who prefer to be honorable face suspicion and persecution from a variety of quarters, because their magic is misunderstood and typically wielded by villains. Even though these hexblades choose to do good, most are forced to the shadows by suspicion and fear from common folk, and they must strike at evil in secret, working behind the scenes to keep the fragile structure of civilization intact."},{"@name":"Hexblade","@type":"Grants","@internal-id":"ID_INTERNAL_GRANTS_HEXBLADE","@source":"Player Essentials: Heroes of the Fallen

Sinister fey creatures, agents of the Unseelie, lurk in the shadows of forests and wait for passing prey. The most powerful of these creatures extend their reach beyond their own realm, tempting and warping the minds of mortals.\n\tFey pact binders are a means by which dark fey extend their grasp outside of the Feywild. Binders who form pacts with these powerful Unseelie wield shadow-tainted arcane magic, reflecting the dark, corrupted natures of the fey creatures they serve. Many binders have learned not just how to coax knowledge out of these dark fey creatures, but how to become one of them; the unwary fey pact binder is often corrupted by the same malevolence that empowers his or her benefactor.\n\tAlternatively, your fey pact binder might be a dark fey that has taken on the guise of one of the friendlier races, openly using knowledge of Unseelie power while disguising his or her true nature. Such an elaborate disguise often requires the dark fey to actually transform into one of the mortal races; more than just a disguise, the mortal body is a prison in which the power of the dark fey resides."},{"@name":"Gloom Pact Boon (Binder)","@type":"Class Feature","@internal-id":"ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_3684","@source":"Player Essentials: Heroes of Shadow","@revision-date":"4/11/2011 1:43:54 PM","Category":{"$":"1"},"Flavor":{"$":"You have an aptitude for the shaping of shadow.
