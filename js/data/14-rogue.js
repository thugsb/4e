After all, once you have grabbed a treasure, your next goal is to escape. Slaying a treasure's guards is one way to avoid capture, but it is messy, noisy, and liable to create further complications for you. You know how to move quickly to slip past an enemy.\n\tWhen you must stand and fight, the same talents that make your escape possible prove just as useful. Misdirection opens gaps in an enemy's defenses, while a quick maneuver puts you in the perfect spot to find a gap in a monster's armor. \n\tThese tactics and abilities are called tricks. Tricks are powers, usually move actions that allow you to shift or move and gain an additional benefit. Some tricks grant you a special type of move, such as the ability to run along a wall or shift past an enemy.
