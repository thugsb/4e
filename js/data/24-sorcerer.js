Elementalists gain no encounter or daily attack powers from their class, but instead rely on at-will attack powers that have additional effects activated with the elemental escalation power."},{"@name":"Supplemental","$":"Ability Scores\nYour elementalist sorcerer requires a superior Charisma score, since all your attacks are based on that ability.

A good Dexterity or Intelligence makes sense as your third-best ability score, providing you with a solid Reflex defense.

Elementalist sorcerers might fashion whips or darts out of fire, create shields and armor from living rock, or inundate their enemies beneath torrents of water.\n\tSince elementalists arise from very different magic-using traditions, other users of arcane power shun them. These sorcerers practice their arts in isolated monasteries, secretive cabals, and occasionally elemental cults. Often accused of being more reckless and destructive than other kinds of sorcerers, elementalists in turn sneer at spellcasters who seek to create tools and systems for shaping magic at a safe distance. To elementalists, the only right way to wield magic is to dive in headlong and seize power with both hands. Some believe that elementalists are prone to evil or that they revel in reckless destruction, but neither assertion is necessarily true.
