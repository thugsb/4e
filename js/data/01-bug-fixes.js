These remnants are diverse in their backgrounds and motives. As a vestige pact warlock, you can choose from between two or more vestige pacts to fuel your arcane power.\nEyes of the Vestige: You know the eyes of the vestige spell. You gain an additional effect, referred to as an eyes of the vestige augment, associated with your active vestige (see below) when you make a successful attack with this power.\nPact Boon: You have a pact boon associated with your active vestige.\nWhen an enemy under your Warlock's Curse drops to 0 hit points or fewer, you gain the benefit of your active vestige's pact boon.\nUsing Vestiges\nYou always have one active vestige. As a beginning character, you have access to the two primary vestiges: King Elidyr and Zutwa. You select one of these as your active vestige after a short rest or an extended rest.\nChanging Your Vestige: You can gain temporary access to other vestiges by using certain daily attack powers. (For ease of identification, all these powers have names that begin with “Vestige.”) When you use a power that gives you access to a daily power vestige, you can choose for that vestige to immediately become your active vestige. If you do so, it remains your active vestige until you gain access to a different vestige by using another daily attack power or until the end of the encounter. If you don't immediately choose to change to that daily power vestige, your access to that vestige is lost until the next time you use that power.\nAfter a short rest or an extended rest, you again select one of the two primary vestiges to be your active vestige. That vestige remains active until you change to a daily power vestige or until you take another short rest or extended rest.\nIn addition, certain benefits allow you to change your vestige at a different time or under different circumstances (See Vestige Pact Boons"},{"@name":"Anticipate Attack (Rogue)","@type":"Power","@internal-id":"ID_FMP_POWER_12324","@source":"Martial Power","@revision-date":"8/27/2010 12:03:03 PM","Category":{"$":"ID_INTERNAL_CATEGORY_UTILITY,ID_INTERNAL_CATEGORY_ENCOUNTER_USAGE,ID_FMP_CLASS_6,ID_FMP_CATEGORY_36,ID_INTERNAL_CATEGORY_IMMEDIATE_INTERRUPT,16"},"Flavor":{"$":"You sense the attack before it comes."},"Prereqs":{"$":"You must have training in Insight."},"print-prereqs":{"$":"You must have training in Insight."},"specific":[{"@name":"Power Usage","$":"Encounter"},{"@name":"_SkillPower"},{"@name":"Display","$":"Rogue Utility 16"},{"@name":"Keywords","$":"Martial"},{"@name":"Action Type","$":"Immediate Interrupt"},{"@name":"Attack Type","$":"Personal"},{"@name":"Trigger","$":"You are hit by an attack."},{"@name":"Requirement","$":"You must have training in Insight."},{"@name":"Effect","$":"You gain a +4 bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn."},{"@name":"_Associated Feats"},{"@name":"Class","$":"ID_FMP_CLASS_6"},{"@name":"Level","$":"16"},{"@name":"Power Type","$":"Utility"}]},{"@name":"Black Arrow Style","@type":"Feat","@internal-id":"ID_FMP_FEAT_1296","@source":"Dragon Magazine 373","@revision-date":"8/27/2010 12:18:51 PM","Prereqs":{"$":"Any martial class, trained in Stealth"},"print-prereqs":{"$":"Any martial class, trained in Stealth"},"specific":[{"@name":"Tier","$":"Heroic"},{"@name":"Short Description","$":"Augment deft strike and twin strike powers"},{"@name":"Special"},{"@name":"type"},{"@name":"Associated Power Info"},{"@name":"Associated Powers"}],"rules":{"modify":[{"@name":"Deft Strike","@type":"Power","@Field":"Black Arrow Style","@value":"If you move into an obscured space or gain cover before making a ranged attack with this exploit, you can make a Stealth check against your target's passive Perception as a free action to gain combat advantage against your target until the start of your next turn."},{"@name":"Twin Strike","@type":"Power","@Field":"Black Arrow Style","@value":"While you are hidden, you can use this exploit to make a ranged attack, and if you miss with the first ranged attack, you can choose to cancel the second attack to remain hidden from your target.
