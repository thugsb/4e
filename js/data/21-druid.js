Cycle class feature.\n    Your animal companion is considered an ally of you and your allies. It can be affected by powers in the same way as any other creature can be.\n    You can communicate telepathically with your animal companion as long as it is within 20 squares of you. You do not need line of sight or line of effect to do so. Your animal companion has only animal intelligence, so it cannot communicate or understand complex topics.\n    Your animal companion's level is equal to yours, and its hit points, defenses, and attacks are determined by your level, as noted in its stat block.\n    Your animal companion shares your healing surge total. Whenever an effect requires your animal companion to spend a healing surge, the surge is deducted from your total. Whenever you use your second wind, your animal companion also regains hit points equal to your healing surge value. At the end of a short rest, your animal companion regains all its hit points.\n    If you die or your animal companion drops to 0 hit points, it disappears as the primal magic that sustains it dissipates. You have two ways of calling your companion back:\n    * Minor Action: You take a minor action and lose a healing surge. Doing so causes your animal companion to appear in the nearest unoccupied space, with hit points equal to your healing surge value.\n    * Short or Extended Rest: You lose a healing surge at the end of a rest. Doing so causes your animal companion to appear in the nearest unoccupied space, with full hit points.\n    As a creature under your control, your animal companion relies on you for strict guidance while you are within 20 squares of it. You take actions so that it can act, and its initiative is the same as yours during an encounter.\n    Standard Actions: To take a standard action, your animal companion needs you to take a standard action to command it to do so.\n    Move Actions: Whenever you take a move action, your animal companion can also take a move action. Alternatively, you can stay put but take a move action to command your animal companion to take a move action.\n    Minor Actions: To take a minor action, your animal companion needs you to take a minor action to command it to do so.\n    Free Actions: Your animal companion can take free actions without you taking an action to command it.\n    Triggered Actions: If one of your animal companion's triggered actions is triggered, the companion can take that action only if you take the same kind of action to command it to do so. For example, if an enemy adjacent to your companion provokes an opportunity attack from it, you must take an opportunity action to command your companion to make the attack.\n    In situations where you can't give commands to your animal companion, it can act independently. For example, if you are unconscious or if you are more than 20 squares away from your companion, it doesn't sit around waiting for you to show up (unless that's what you have previously commanded it to do).\n    An animal companion acting independently can take either a standard, a move, or a minor action on its turn. It can also take opportunity actions and free actions, but it cannot take immediate actions."},{"@name":"Companion","@type":"Information","@internal-id":"ID_INTERNAL_INFORMATION_COMPANION","@source":"Core","$":"Beastmaster rangers, Sentinel druids, and characters with the Arcane Familiar feat gain companions which are selected on this page.\n    A Beastmaster Ranger gains a beast companion, chosen from one of these categories: bear, boar, cat, lizard, raptor, serpent, spider, or wolf. These categories do not describe specific animals, but rather groups of similarly themed creatures in the D&D world. You decide the creature's relevant details—its species, physical details, and so forth—making sure they are appropriate for its category and the campaign.\n    For example, if your character hails from a swampy region, your lizard companion might be a crocodile.

To select this class feature, you must give up the Prime Shot class feature, and you do not select either the Archer Fighting Style or the Two-Blade Fighting Style.\nYou gain a beast companion, chosen from one of these categories: bear, boar, cat, lizard, raptor, serpent, spider, or wolf. These categories do not describe specific animals, but rather groups of similarly themed creatures in the D&D world. You decide the creature's relevant details—its species, physical details, and so forth—making sure they are appropriate for its category and the campaign.\n\tFor example, if your character hails from a swampy region, your lizard companion might be a crocodile. The lizard companion of a ranger from a different region might be a giant monitor lizard or a drake. A beast companion's species doesn't affect its game statistics, which are based on its category and level.\n\tYou and your beast companion work so well together that the creature is almost an extension of you. Using your actions in combat, you control your beast companion by issuing it commands.\n\tBeast Mastery also alters your Hunter's Quarry class feature. When you use Hunter's Quarry, your quarry can be either the enemy nearest to you that you can see or the enemy nearest to your beast companion that you can see. You or your beast companion can deal the extra damage from Hunter's Quarry, but only one of you can deal this extra damage per round.\n\tYour beast companion is considered a creature and an ally and can be affected by powers. A cleric can heal it with healing word, a warlord can give it a melee basic attack with commander's strike, and so forth. You and your beast companion are treated as separate creatures.\n\tYou can have only one beast companion at a time. You can dismiss your beast companion at any time, but gaining a new one isn't a simple task.The link between a ranger and his or her beast companion is not one of master and servant but of two close friends.\n\tAs part of the training you underwent that allowed you to form a close bond with a beast, you learned the Raise Beast Companion ritual, which allows you to raise your companion from the dead, even if you are otherwise unable to master and perform rituals."},{"@name":"Wolf Companion","@type":"Class Feature","@internal-id":"ID_WOG_SENTINEL_CLASS_FEATURE_2A","@source":"Player Essentials: Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms","Category":{"$":"ID_FMP_CLASS_779"},"Flavor":{"$":"Wolves are stealthy predators that prowl the forests and tundra.

By ensuring that the land, the water, and the sky inhabited by ihe primal spirits is protected, you become a staunch defender of those who live in harmony with nature and show respect for their natural surroundings.\nYou might go out into the world to seek new experiences and powerful artifacts of primal magic.
