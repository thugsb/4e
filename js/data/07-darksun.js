Regardless of the beasts of burden or the goods carried, caravans are crucial to maintaining Athasian civilization. Not only do they carry valuable goods from one city to the next, they also carry rumors and tales of doings all across the Tyr Region to people thirsty for news of other places, provide travelers with the opportunity to surround themselves with the safety of numbers, and feed scores of desert outposts and settlements with a steady stream of food and supplies.\n\tLeading a successful caravan is no mean feat.

From day to day, a caravan master might have to lead the guards and drivers in battle, search out a new path when a familiar road is buried in the shifting sands, bribe greedy officials, or enforce brutal discipline on a rebellious underling.

You might have been chosen for an arcane education while still young and tutored in the ways of magic by templar instructors, or perhaps you gained the king's sanction by other means—as a reward for some great service to the king or the city, through bribery, or by the manipulation of powerful nobles or senior templars exercising the king's favor. If you are not a native of a city-state, the only sanction you require is sheer power: You can defile freely if your tribe protects you, or if you are so powerful that no one dares to challenge you.\nIf you are one of a sorcerer-king's sanctioned defilers, you might be expected to make yourself available for special tasks or duties as needed. Such assignments are rare, however; most sorcerer-kings allow master defilers in their cities to do more or less as they wish, trusting that they won't jeopardize the city or themselves.

Many muls of both genders are hairless, although some grow topknots of dark hair. Their faces hint at their dwarven ancestry, with strong, stern features and small, swept-back ears that come to subtle points. Mul skin and eye colors are as varied as they are in humans, but many muls have a copper or deeply bronzed complexion, and a few have eyes of a startling honey-gold or green-gold color.\n\tMuls have little collective racial identity and adopt the dress and fashion of their homes.

Muls make outstanding gladiators, slave warriors, and heavy laborers, enduring toil and hardships that would kill lesser folk.\n\tMuls who set their hearts on freedom are difficult to keep in chains. Some escape to the wilds and become raiders or join tribes of ex-slaves, whereas others who escape become mercenaries and sell their fighting skills to whomever they can. Muls who don't flee captivity can win their freedom in the arena or by completing a dangerous task for their masters. A few highly prized gladiators receive so many privileges and comforts that they are effectively free, enjoying great latitude to go where they want and do as they wish. The Dungeon Master might have mul heroes start the campaign as slaves. If not, assume that your mul character has already won his or her freedom by the time the game begins.\n\tMuls are hard, driven, pragmatic folk with little remorse or sympathy in their hearts. Many grow up under the lash, having been taken from their parents while very young and subjected to brutal training for the arena or grinding toil in fields or quarries. Consequently, muls have a hard time offering friendship and trust to anyone. More than a few muls, scarred by the hardships of their upbringing, spend their days as bitter, violent misanthropes. Others are suspicious, grasping mercenaries who have learned never to lift a finger on behalf of another person without establishing what they will gain from providing aid. Despite their tendency to be sullen or self-centered, muls can learn to work alongside others.

Their lowest pair of limbs is used as legs, and their upper pair of limbs serves as arms. The middle set of limbs is small but nimble, and the kreen use them for fine manipulation, leaving heavy work to the stronger upper arms. Both middle and upper hands have three clawed fingers and one opposable thumb. In combat, thri-kreen hold weapons or shields in their upper limbs, since the middle pair lacks the strength and using both sets of limbs would be awkward and unwieldy.\n\nSwift and athletic, thri-kreen are natural climbers and jumpers. Their wedge-shaped heads have large compound eyes, two (mostly vestigial) antennae, and powerful mandibles. They can speak an oddly accented form of Common but prefer their own language, which is easier to pronounce with their mouth parts.\n\nThri-kreen have short life spans and rarely reach 30 years of age."},{"@name":"Playing","$":"Thri-kreen minds, behavior, and physiology often seem bizarre to members of other races. Most Athasians don't understand the kreen and find them more than a little threatening. However, despite their fierce appearance, the insectlike humanoids can be loyal and courageous companions. Thri-kreen have most of the same needs and morals as do other races; they simply prioritize those needs and morals differently. Most important, thri-kreen judge others solely on physical and mental ability. The lazy and weak deserve contempt, regardless of race; likewise, strength and cleverness merit respect no matter who demonstrates these qualities.\n\nThri-kreen view everything through the lens of the hunt and the predator-prey relationship. Their basic social units are the clutch and the pack. A clutch is a small group (of no more than six) to which an individual kreen has a close bond. The concept of the clutch combines Դeam,ԠԦriends,Ԡand Ԧamily.ԠEvery thri-kreen has a birth clutch that consists of all surviving members of the group of eggs from which it hatched. Later in life, each kreen forms one or more other clutches, perhaps centered around adventuring groups or specialized hunting parties. A pack is a larger social unit that consists of any number of clutches. If deprived of a clutch, a thri-kreen is biologically compelled to seek out a new group to join.\n\nObeying their pack instincts, thri-kreen try to find their place in any group. They use a series of challenges to determine the pecking order, assessing their possible clutchmates in secret or, when necessary, demanding trial by combat. Thri-kreen seize leadership of groups in which they're the strongest members, but they are willing to accept subordinate roles in the presence of powerful allies. They take orders from the pack or clutch leader without hesitation, eager to fulfill the duties of their position in the hierarchy. Despite the apparent autocracy of a kreen group, any member is free to voice its opinion and offer advice. Indeed, each thri-kreen is expected to have expertise in matters the others do not. All can and must contribute to the good of the clutch and the success of the hunt.\n\nIn thri-kreen culture, the hunt is pervasive and crucial, and combat is just another kind of hunt. Thri-kreen rarely fight out of malice and see no need for aggression unless it is the best means of obtaining the resources they need to survive. Self-defense is another matterء thri-kreen who has been attacked can't fathom any response other than a violent counterattack. After a victorious battle, a kreen's first instinct is to collect any useful possessions that belonged to the attacker or (in the case of beasts) to harvest the body for food.\n\nMany thri-kreen develop psionic abilities. Those who fully pursue these gifts often become monks or battleminds, taking advantage of their physical talents. Some attribute this natural ability to the thri-kreen's racial memory. Each member of the race is born with the clutch mentality and an innate knowledge of the thri-kreen language.

These battleminds channel raw psionic energy fueled by their untamed emotions. They often develop their powers as a result of a traumatic or a dangerous experience that triggers their psionic talent as a defense mechanism.\n\tThe wild battlemind is the most common type of battlemind on Athas. These individuals live in the wastes or the slums, growing up without the privileges afforded to nobles who receive formal training in the Way. The aggressive, powerful attacks of a wild battlemind reflect the brutality of life under the red sun. It's not unusual for a wild battlemind to end up as a gladiator in the arenas of Athas.\n\tThe deadly and unpredictable wild battleminds are born to be warriors. From an early age, they learn the ways of psionic combat through trial and error. They often craft their own weapons, chipping away at shards of obsidian or lashing together bones and teeth. They favor two-handed weapons, which they can use to great effect in battle.\n\tLike other battleminds, you should make Constitution your primary ability score, because you use it to make your psionic attacks. Choose Charisma as your secondary ability score. Charisma improves your Wild Focus class feature and enhances many of your battlemind powers.

Fighters have the weapon training, the armor training, and the adaptability to respond to a variety of threats. Any fighter build might be appropriate in Athas's arenas, but the arena fighter represents the epitome of combat in the coliseums.\n\tAs with other fighters, Strength should be your highest ability score, because you use it for your attack powers.
