If you are a member of a class that can use a wand as an implement, you can apply the enhancement bonus of a wand to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of any of your powers from that class that have the implement keyword, and you can use a wand's properties and powers. Members of other classes gain no benefit from wielding a wand.\nUsing a wand's power works like using the power normally. To do so, you need to be able to use at least one power from the same power source as the wand.\nFor example, a rogue who has picked up at least one wizard power through multiclassing feats could use a wizard power in a wand, since each knows one power that uses the arcane power source. Several wands appear below, but you can also design your own.\nA wand can contain an encounter power of any class capable of using wands. When you craft a wand, you can choose any encounter power that you know or that is available to your class. You can't choose anything other than a class power (you can't choose a paragon path power, for instance).)."},{"@name":"Weight"},{"@name":"Gold","$":"15"},{"@name":"WeaponEquiv"},{"@name":"Group","$":"Wand"},{"@name":"Properties","$":"Distant, Energized (lightning)"},{"@name":"_DamageType","$":"Lightning"},{"@name":"Item Slot","$":"Off-hand"}],"rules":{"statadd":[{"@name":"Rowan wand","@value":"+2"},{"@name":"implement,Lightning:damage(Rowan wand)","@value":"+Rowan wand","@type":"Superior Implement","@requires":"Superior Implement Training (Rowan wand)"},{"@name":"Rowan wand","@value":"+1","@requires":"Paragon Tier"},{"@name":"Rowan wand","@value":"+1","@requires":"Epic Tier"}],"grant":[{"@name":"WearingWand","@type":"Category"},{"@name":"WearingRowanWand","@type":"Category"}]},"$":"A rowan wand is polished wood engraved with lightning motifs."},{"@name":"Brew Potion","@type":"Ritual","@internal-id":"ID_FMP_RITUAL_1","@source":"Player's Handbook","@revision-date":"11/05/2010 00:00:00 AM","Flavor":{"$":"Liquids brew and bubble, coalescing the raw substance of magic into a form you can drink."},"specific":[{"@name":"Category","$":"Creation"},{"@name":"Key Skill","$":"Arcana or Religion (no check)"},{"@name":"Component Cost","$":"Special"},{"@name":"Duration","$":"Permanent until consumed"},{"@name":"Level","$":"1"},{"@name":"Time","$":"1 hour"},{"@name":"Market Price","$":"75 gp"},{"@name":"Prerequisite"},{"@name":"type","$":"Ritual"}],"$":"You create a common potion or elixir of your level or lower.
