Usually this faith is the worship of a specific patron deity–for example, Moradin, Pelor, or Erathis. Sometimes clerics are devoted to churches that venerate groups of deities or even philosophies.\n\tAs a cleric, your deity does not directly grant you powers. Instead, your ordination or investiture as a cleric grants you the ability to wield divine powers. Clerics are usually formally ordained by existing clerics who perform a special ritual to do so, but on rare occasions a deity moves to directly ordain a worthy worshiper without any sort of priestly hierarchy involved. What you do with your powers once you are ordained is up to you, although if you flagrantly and openly defy your deity's tenets, you quickly earn the enmity of the faithful.\nGood, Lawful Good, and Unaligned Deities\n<table>Deity\tAlignment\tAreas of Influence\nAvandra\tGood\tChange, luck, trade, travel\nBahamut\tLawful good\tJustice, honor, nobility,\n\t\tprotection\nCorellon\tUnaligned\tArcane magic, spring,\n\t\tbeauty, the arts\nErathis\tUnaligned\tCivilization, invention, laws\nIoun\tUnaligned\tKnowledge, prophecy, skill\nKord\tUnaligned\tStorms, strength, battle\nMelora\tUnaligned\tWilderness, sea\nMoradin\tLawful good\tCreation, artisans, family\nPelor\tGood\tSun, summer, agriculture,\n\t\ttime\nRaven Queen\tUnaligned\tDeath, fate, winter\nSehanine\tUnaligned\tTrickery, moon, love, autumn</table>\nEvil and Chaotic Evil Deities\n<table>Deity\tAlignment\tAreas of Influence\nAsmodeus\tEvil\tPower, domination, tyranny\nBane\tEvil\tWar, conquest\nGruumsh\tChaotic evil\tTurmoil, destruction\nLolth\tChaotic evil\tSpiders, shadows, lies\nTiamat\tEvil\tWealth, greed, vengeance\nTorog\tEvil\tUnderdark, imprisonment\nVecna\tEvil\tUndeath, secrets\nZehir\tEvil\tDarkness, poison, serpents</table>\nYou must choose a deity compatible with your alignment: Good clerics serve good deities, lawful good clerics serve lawful good deities, and so on. If a deity is unaligned, your alignment doesn't matter–so a deity such as Melora has good, lawful good, evil, chaotic evil, and unaligned clerics in her service. Similarly, if you're unaligned, you can serve any god. For example, Pelor is served by both good clerics and unaligned clerics, but never by evil, chaotic evil, or lawful good clerics.\n\tFor most games, you should choose a good, lawful good, or unaligned deity for your cleric. Ask your Dungeon Master before you select an evil or chaotic evil deity."},{"@name":"Implement","$":"Clerics make use of holy symbols to help channel and direct their divine powers. A cleric wearing or holding a magic holy symbol can add its enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls to powers with the implement keyword. Without a holy symbol, a cleric can still use these powers, but he or she doesn't gain the bonus provided by the magic implement."},{"@name":"Powers","$":"Your cleric powers are called prayers.
